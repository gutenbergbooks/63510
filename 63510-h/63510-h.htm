  <h2 class='c004'>TO THE READER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>The time is not perhaps far distant when few will
believe in miracles who do not also believe in an
infallible Church; and then, such books as the present
will appeal to a larger circle. But, as things are, the
author would beg all those who worship a miraculous
Christ without doubt and difficulty to pause here and
read no further. The book is not intended for them;
it is intended for those alone to whom it is dedicated,
“the doubters of this generation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>For there are some who feel drawn towards the
worship of Christ by love and reverence, yet repelled
by an apparently inextricable connection of the story
of Christ with a miraculous element which, in their
minds, throws a doubt over the whole of His acts,
His doctrine, His character, and even His existence.
Others, who worship Christ, worship Him insecurely
and tremulously. They assume that their faith
must rest on the basis of the Bible miracles; and at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>times they cannot quite suppress a thrill of doubt and
terror lest some horrible discovery of fresh truth,
resulting in the destruction of the miraculous element
of the Bible, may impair their right to regard Christ
as “anything better than a mere man.” It is to
these two classes—the would-be worshippers and the
doubtful worshippers of Christ—that the following
Letters are addressed by one who has for many years
found peace and salvation in the worship of a non
miraculous Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not very long ago, but some years after the
publication of a work called <i>Philochristus</i>, the author
received a letter from a stranger and fellow-clergyman,
asking him whether he could spare half an hour to
visit him on his death-bed, “dying of a disease”—so
ran the letter “which will be fatal within some
uncertain weeks (possibly however days, possibly
months). No pains just now, head clear, voice
sound. And mind at peace, but the peace of
reverent agnosticism..... Now I have read and
appreciated <i>Philochristus</i>. It would comfort my
short remainder of life if you would come and look
me dying in the face and say, ‘This theology and
Christology of mine is not merely literary: I feel
with joy of heart that God is not unknown to man:
try even now to feel with me.’”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>Of what passed at the subsequent interview nothing
must be said except that the dying man (whose
anticipations of death were speedily verified) expressed
the conviction that one reason why he had fallen into
that abyss of agnosticism—for an abyss he then felt
it to be—was that he had been “taught to believe
too much when young;” and he urged and almost
besought that something might be done soon to “give
young men a religion that would wear.” These words
were not to be forgotten; they recurred again and
again to the author with the force of a command.
The present work is an attempt to carry them into
effect, an attempt, by one who has passed through
doubts into conviction, to look the doubting reader in
the face and say, “This theology and Christology of
mine is not merely literary. I feel with joy of heart
that God is not unknown to man. Try even now to
feel with me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The author does not profess to clear Christianity
from all “difficulties.” If a revelation is to enlarge
our conceptions of God, it must involve some spiritual
effort on our part to receive the larger truth; if it
claims to be historical, it may well impose on some of
its adherents the labour needed for the judgment of
historical evidence; if it prompts, without enforcing,
obedience, it must excite in all some questionings as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>to the causes which led the Revealer not to make
His revelation irresistibly convincing. Even the explanations
of the mysterious phenomena of motion,
light, and chemistry, involve “difficulties” in the
acceptance of still more mysterious Laws which we
cannot at present explain. Nevertheless we all feel
that we understand astronomy better in the light of
the Law of gravitation: and in the same way some
may feel that Christianity becomes more spiritual,
as well as more clear, when it becomes more natural;
and that many of its so-called “difficulties” fade or
vanish, when what may be called its celestial and its
terrestrial phenomena are found to rest upon similar
principles.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>
  <h2 id='let01' class='c004'>I <br /> INTRODUCTORY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>I am more pained than surprised to infer from your
last letter that your faith has received a severe shock.
A single term at the University has sufficed to make you
doubt whether you retain a belief in miracles; and “If
miracles fall, the Bible falls; and with the fall of the Bible
I lose Christ; and if I must regard Christ as a fanatic, I
do not see how I can believe in a God who suffered such
a one as Christ thus to be deceived and to deceive others.”
Such appear to be the thoughts that are passing through
your mind, as I infer them from incidental and indirect
expressions rather than from any definite statement.</p>

<p class='c006'>Unfortunately I understand all this too well not to be
able to follow with ease such phases of disbelief even
when conveyed in hints. Many young men begin by being
taught to believe too much, a great deal too much. Then,
when they find they must give up something, (the husk
of the kernel) their teachers too often bid them swallow
husk and all, on pain of swallowing nothing: and they
prefer to swallow nothing. An instance of this at once
occurs to me. Many years ago, a young man who wished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>to be ordained, asked me to read the Old Testament with
him. We set to work at once and read some miraculous
history—I forget precisely what—in which I thought my
young friend must needs see a difficulty. So I began to
point out how the difficulty might be at least diminished
by critical considerations. I say “I began”: for I stopped
as soon as I had begun, finding that my friend saw no
difficulty at all. He accepted every miracle on every page
of the Old and New Testament on the authority of the
Bible; just as a Roman Catholic accepts every ecclesiastical
doctrine on the authority of the Church. This seemed
to me not a state of mind that I ought to interfere with: I
might do more harm than good. So I stopped. But I have
since regretted it. Circumstances prevented me from
meeting my friend for some weeks. During that time he
had fallen in with companions of negative views, against
which he had no power to maintain his position: and
he had passed from believing everything to believing
nothing. That is only too easy a transition; but I hope
you will never experience it. Surely there is a medium
between swallowing the husk, and throwing the nut away.
Is it not possible to throw away the husk and keep the
kernel?</p>

<p class='c006'>Now I have no right (and therefore I try to feel no
wish) to extract from you a confidence that you do not
care to repose in me. I have never tried to shake any
one’s faith in miracles. There may come—I think there
will soon come—a time when a belief in miracles will be
found so incompatible with the reverence which we ought
to feel for the Supreme Order as almost to necessitate
superstition, and to encourage immorality in the holder
of the belief: and then it might be necessary to express
one’s condemnation of miracles plainly and even aggressively.
But that time has not come yet: and for most
people, at present, an acceptance of miracles seems, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>perhaps is, a necessary basis for their acceptance of
Christ. In such minds I would no more wish to disturb
the belief in miracles than I would shake a little child’s
faith that his father is perfectly good and wise. But when
a man says, “the miracles of Christ are inextricably connected
with the life of Christ; I am forced to reject the
former, and therefore I must also reject the latter”—then
I feel moved to shew him that there is no such inextricable
connection, and that Christ will remain for us a
necessary object of worship, even if we detach the miracles
from the Gospels. Now I cannot do this without shewing
that the miraculous accounts stand on a lower level than
the rest of the Gospel narrative, and that they may have
been easily introduced into the Gospels without any sufficient
basis of fact, and yet without any intention to
deceive; so that the discrediting of the miracles will not
discredit their non-miraculous context. In doing this, I
might possibly destroy any lingering vestige of belief which
you may still have in the miraculous; and this I am most
unwilling to do, if you find miracles a necessary foundation
of Christian faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not therefore quite know as yet how I ought to try
to help you, except by saying that I have myself passed
through the same valley of doubt through which you are
passing now, and that I have reached a faith in Christ
which is quite independent of any belief in the miraculous,
and which enables me not only to trust in Him, but also
to worship Him. This new faith appears to me purer,
nobler, and happier, as well as safer, than the old: but I
do not feel sure that it is attainable (in the present condition
of thought) without more unprejudiced reflection
and study than most people are willing to devote to
subjects of this kind. And to give up the old faith,
without attaining the new, would be a terrible disaster.
Hence I am in doubt, not about what is best, but about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>what may be <i>best for you</i>. Do not at all events assume—so
much I can safely say—that you must give up your
faith in Christ, if you are obliged to give up your belief in
miracles. At the very least, wait a while; stand on the
old paths; keep up the old habits, above all, the habit of
prayer; pause and look round you a little before taking
the next step. I do not say, though I am inclined to say,
“avoid for the present all discussions with people of
negative views,” because I fear my advice, though really
prudent, would seem to you cowardly: but I do unhesitatingly
say, “avoid all frivolous talk, and light, airy,
epigrammatic conversations on religious subjects.” You
cannot hope to retain or regain faith if you throw away
the habit of reverence. With this advice, farewell for
the present.</p>

  <h2 id='let02' class='c009'>II <br /> PERSONAL</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>You tell me that you fear your faith is far too roughly
shaken to suffer now from anything that may be said
against miracles: you are utterly convinced that they
are false. As for the possibility of worshipping a non-miraculous
Christ, “the very notion of it,” you say, “is
inconceivable: it seems like a new religion, and must
surely be no more than a very transient phase of thought.”
But you would “very much like to know what processes
of reasoning led to such a state of mind,” and how long
I have retained it.</p>

<p class='c006'>I think I am hardly doing you an injustice in inferring
from some other expressions in your letter, about “the
difficulty which clergymen must necessarily feel in putting
themselves into the mental position of the laity,” that you
entertain some degree of prejudice against my views, not
only because they appear to you novel, but because—although
you hardly like to say so—they come from a
clerical source, and are likely to savour of clericalism.
Let me see if I can put your thoughts into the plain words
from which your own modesty and sense of propriety
have caused you to refrain. “A clergyman,” you say to
yourself, “has enlisted; he has deliberately taken a side
and is bound to fight for it. After twenty years of seeing
one side of a question, or only so much of the other side
as is convenient to see, how can even a candid, middle-aged
cleric see two sides impartially? All his interests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>combine with all his sympathies to make him at least in
some sense orthodox. The desire of social esteem, the
hope of preferment, loyalty to the Church, loyalty to
Christ Himself, make him falsely true to that narrow
form of truth which he has bound himself to serve. Even
if truth and irresistible conviction force him to deviate a
little from the beaten road of orthodoxy, he will find
his way back by some circuitous by-path; and of this
kind of self-persuasion I have a remarkable instance in
the person of my old friend, who rejects miracles and
yet persuades himself that he worships Christ. He has
cut away his foundations and now proceeds to substitute
an aerial basis upon which the old superstructure is to
remain as before. Such a novel condition of mind as this
can only be a very transient phase.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not complain of this prejudice against novelty,
although it comes ungraciously from one who is himself
verging on advanced and novel views. It is good that
new opinions should be suspiciously scrutinized and passed
through the quarantine of prejudice. And when a man
feels (as I do) that he has at last attained a profound
spiritual truth which will, in all probability, be generally
accepted by educated Christians who are not Roman
Catholics, before the twentieth century is far advanced, he
can well afford to be patient of prejudice. Even though
the truth be not accepted now, it is pretty sure to be restated
by others with more skill and cogency, and perhaps
at a fitter season, and to gain acceptance in due time.
But when you speak of my opinions as a “transient phase,”
which I am likely soon to give up, and when you shew a
manifest suspicion that any modicum of orthodoxy in me
must needs be the result of a clerical bias, then I hardly
see how to reply except by giving you a detailed answer
to your question about “the processes” by which I was led
to “such a novel condition of mind.” Yet how to do this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>without being somewhat egotistically autobiographical
I do not know. Some good may come of egotism perhaps,
if it leads you to see that even a clergyman may think for
himself, and work out a religious problem without regard
to consequences. So on the whole I think I will risk
egotism for your sake. A few paragraphs of autobiography
may serve as a summary of the argument which I might
draw out more fully in future letters. If I am tedious,
lay the blame on yourself and on your insinuation that my
views must be “a transient phase.” A man who is getting
on towards his fiftieth year and has retained a form—a
novel form if you please—of religious conviction for a full
third of his life may surely claim that his views—so far at
least as he himself is concerned—are not to be called
“transient.” Prepare then for my <i>Apologia</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>During my childhood I was very much left to myself in
the matter of religion, and may be almost said to have
picked it up in a library. I was never made to learn the
Creed by heart, nor the Catechism, nor even the Ten
Commandments; and to this day I can recollect being
reproached by a class-master when I was nearly fourteen
years old, for not knowing which was the Fifth Commandment.
All that I could plead in answer was, that if he
would tell me what it was about, I could give him the substance
of the precept. Having read through nearly the
whole of Adam Clarke’s commentary as a boy of ten or
eleven, and having subsequently imbued myself with books
of Evangelical doctrine, I was perfectly “up,” or thought I
was, in the Pauline scheme of salvation, and felt a most
lively interest—on Sundays, and in dull moments on week
days, and especially in times of illness, of which I had
plenty—in the salvation of my own soul. My religion
served largely to intensify my natural selfishness. In better
and healthier moments, my conscience revolted against it;
and at times I felt that the morality of Plutarch’s Lives was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>better than that of St. Paul’s Epistles—as I interpreted
them. Only to one point in the theology of my youthful
days can I now look back with pleasure; and that is to
my treatment of the doctrine of Predestinarianism and
necessity. On this matter I argued as follows: “If God
knows all things beforehand, God has them, or may have
them, written down in a book; and if all things that are
going to happen are already written down in a book, it’s of
no use our trying to alter them. So, if it’s predestined that
I shall have my dinner to-day, I shall certainly have it, even
if I don’t come home in time, or even though I lock myself
up in my bedroom. But <i>practically, if I don’t come home
in time, I know I shall not have my dinner. Therefore
it’s no use talking about these things in this sort of way,
because it doesn’t answer; and I shall not bother myself
any more about Predestination, but act as thought it did
not exist</i>.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a> This argument, if it can be called an argument,
I afterwards found sheltering itself under the high
authority of Butler’s <i>Analogy</i>; and I still adhere to it,
after an experience of more than five and thirty years.
To some, this “Short Way with Predestinarians” may
seem highly illogical; but it <i>works</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Up to this time I had been little, if at all, impressed by
preaching. Our old Rector was a good Greek scholar
and a gentleman; but he had a difficulty in making his
thoughts intelligible to any but a refined minority among
the congregation; and even that select few was made fewer,
partly by an awkwardness of gesture which reminded one
of Dominie Sampson, and partly by a grievous impediment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>in his speech. Consequently I had been permitted,
and indeed encouraged, never to listen, nor even to appear
to listen, to the weekly sermon; and as soon as the Rector
gave out his text, I used to take up my Bible and read
steadily away till the sermon was over. This sort of thing
went on till I was about sixteen years old; when a new
Rector came to preach his first sermon. That was a remarkable
Sunday for me. To my surprise, when he read
out his text, and I, in accordance with unbroken precedent,
reached out my hand for the invariable Bible, my father,
somewhat abruptly, took it out of my hand, bidding me
“for once shut up that book and listen to a sermon.” I
can still remember the resentment I felt at this infringement
on my theological and constitutional rights, and how
I stiffened my neck and hardened my heart and determined
“hearing to hear, but not to understand.” But I
was compelled to understand. For here, to my astonishment,
was an entirely new religion. This man’s Christianity
was not a “scheme of salvation”; it was a faith in
a great Leader, human yet divine, who was leading the
armies of God against the armies of Evil; “Each for
himself is the Devil’s own watchword: but with us it must
be each for Christ, and each for all.” The scales fell from
my eyes. After all, then, Christianity was not less noble
than Plutarch’s lives; it was more noble. There was to
be a contest; yet not each man contending for his own
soul, but for good against evil. A Christian was not a
mercenary fighting for reward, nor a slave fighting for fear
of stripes, but a free soldier fighting out of loyalty to
Christ and to humanity.</p>

<p class='c006'>But what about the doctrine of the Atonement, Justification
by Faith, and the other Pauline doctrines? About
these our new Rector did not say much that I could
understand. He was a foremost pupil of Mr. Maurice,
and in Mr. Maurice’s books (which now began to be read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>freely in my home) I began to search for light on these
questions. But help I found none or very little, except in
one book. Mr. Maurice seemed to me, and still seems,
a very obscure writer. Partly owing to a habit of taking
things for granted and “thinking underground,” partly
(and much more) owing to a confusing use of pronouns for
nouns and other mere mechanical defects of style, he requires
very careful reading. But his book on Sacrifice,
after I had three times read it through, gave me more
intellectual help than perhaps any other book on Christian
doctrine; for here first I learned to look below the surface
of a rite at its inner meaning, and also to discern the
possibility of illustrating that inner meaning by the
phenomena of daily life. It was certainly a revelation
to me to know that the sacrifice of a lamb by a human
offerer was nothing, except so far as it meant the sacrifice of
a human life, and that the sacrifice of a life meant no more
(but also no less) than conforming one’s life to God’s will,
doing (and not saying merely) “Thy will, not mine, be
done.” If one theological process could be illustrated in
this way, why not another? If “sacrifice” was going on
before my eyes every day, why might there not be also
justification by faith, imputation of righteousness, remission
of sins, yes, even atonement itself? Thus there
was sown in my mind the seed of the notion that all
the Pauline doctrines might be natural, and that Redemption
through Christ was only a colossal form of that kind
of redemption which was going on around me, Redemption
through Nature. This thought was greatly stimulated by
the study of <i>In Memoriam</i>, which was given to me by a
college friend about the time when I lost a brother and a
sister, both dying within a few weeks of one another. I
read the poem again and again, and committed much of it
to memory; and it exerted an “epoch-making” influence
on my life. However, for a long time this notion of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>naturalness of Redemption existed for me merely in the
germ.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meantime, as to the miracles I had no doubts at all, or
only such transient doubts as were suggested by pictures
of Holy Families and other sacred subjects, which exhibited
Christ as essentially non-human, with a halo
around his head, or as an infant with three outstretched
fingers blessing his kneeling mother. As a youth, I took
it for granted that God could not become man save by a
miracle, and therefore that the God-man must work
miracles. Further, I assumed that Moses and some of
the prophets had worked miracles, and if so, how could it
be that the Servants should work miracles and the Son
should not? As I grew towards manhood, such rising
qualms of doubt as I felt on this point were stilled by the
suggestion (which I found in Trench’s book on miracles)
that the miracles of Christ must be in accordance with
some latent law of spiritual nature. It was a little strange
certainly that these latent laws should be utilised only for
the children of Abraham, and it was inconvenient that
the miracles of Moses should be, materially speaking, so
stupendously superior to those of Christ; but I took refuge
in the greater beauty and emblematic meaning of the
latter. Even at the time when I signed the Thirty-nine
Articles I had no suspicion that the miracles were not
historical. Partly, I had never critically and systematically
studied the Gospels as one studies Thucydides or
Æschylus; partly the miracles had always been kept in
the background by my Rector and the books of the
Broad Church School, and I had been accustomed to rest
my faith on Christ Himself and not on the miracles; and
so it came to pass that, for some time after I was ordained,
I was quite content to accept all the miracles of the Old
and New Testaments, and to be content with the explanation
suggested by “latent laws.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>But now that I was ordained, I set to work in earnest (the
stress of working for a degree and the need of earning one’s
living had left no time for it before) at the study of the
New Testament. Of course I had “got it up” before, often
enough, for the purpose of passing examinations; but now
I began to study it for its own sake and at leisure. While
reading for the Theological Tripos I had been struck by
the inadequacy of many of the theological books that I
had had to “get up.” Especially on the first three Gospels—looking
at them critically, as I had been accustomed
to look at Greek and Latin books—I was amazed to find
that little or nothing had been done by English scholars
to compare the different styles and analyse the narratives
into their component parts. For such a task I had myself
received some little preparation. I had picked up my
classics without very much assistance from the ordinary
means, mainly by voluntarily committing to memory whole
books or long continuous passages of the best authors,
and so imbuing myself with them as to “get into the
swing of the author.” I had early begun to tabulate these
differences of style; and in my final and most important
University examination I remember sending up more than
one piece of composition rendered in two styles. Though
I was never a first-rate composer, owing to my want of
practice at school, this method had succeeded in bringing
me to the front in “my year”; and I now desired to
apply my classical studies to the criticism of the first
three Gospels. It seemed to me a monstrous thing
that we should have three accounts of the same life,
accounts closely agreeing in certain parts, but widely
varying in others, and yet that, with all the aids of modern
criticism, we should not be able to determine which accounts,
or which parts of the three accounts, were the
earliest. At the same time I began to apply the same
method, though without the same attempt at exactness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>to the study of the text of Shakespeare; in which I perceived
some differences of style that implied difference
of date, and some that appeared to imply difference of
authorship.</p>

<p class='c006'>About this time people began to talk in popular circles
concerning Evolution, and alarm began to be felt in
some quarters at the difficulty of harmonizing its
theories with theology. With these fears I never could
in the least degree sympathize. I welcomed Evolution
as a luminous commentary on the divine scheme of
the Redemption of mankind. That most stimulating of
books, the <i>Advancement of Learning</i>, had taught me to be
prepared to find that in very many cases “while Nature or
man intendeth one thing, God worketh another”; and it
was a joy to me to find new light thrown by Evolution on
the unfathomable problems of waste, death, and conflict.
Death and conflict could never be thus explained—I
knew that—but one was enabled to wait more patiently
for that explanation which will never come to us till we
are behind the veil, when one found that death and
conflict had at least been subordinated to progress and
development. So I thought; and so I said from the
pulpit of one of the Universities in times when the
clergy had not yet learned to call Darwin “a man of
God.” My doctrine was thought “advanced” in those
days; but time has gone on and left me, in some respects,
behind it. I should never have thought, and should not
think now, of calling Darwin “a man of God,” except so
far as all patient seekers after truth are men of God:
but I still adhere to the belief that Evolution has made it
more easy to believe in a rational, that is to say a non-miraculous,
though supernatural, Christianity.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this direction, then, my thoughts went forward and,
so far, found no stumbling block. Guided by the poets
and analytic novelists, I was also learning to find in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>study of the phenomena of daily life fresh illustrations
of the Pauline theology, confirming and developing my
notion (now of some years’ standing) that the Redemption
of mankind was natural, nothing more than a colossal
representation of the spiritual phenomena that may be
seen in ordinary men and women every day of our lives;
just as the lightning-flash is no more than (upon a
large scale) the crackling of the hair beneath the comb.
Good men and women, I perceived, are daily redeeming
the bad, bearing their sins, imputing righteousness to
them, giving up their lives for them, and imbuing them
with a good spirit. This thought, as it gained force, was
a great help towards a rational Christianity.</p>

<p class='c006'>But now my feet began to be entangled in snares and
pitfalls. I had begun the study of the Greek Testament,
believing that it would bring forth <i>some</i> new truth, and
assuming that <i>all</i> truth must tend to the glory of God and
of Christ. “Christ,” I said, “is the living Truth, so that
I have but, as Plato says, to ‘follow the Argument,’ and
that must lead me to the truth, and therefore to Him.”
But I was not prepared for the result. After some years
of work I found myself gradually led to the conclusion
that the miraculous element in the Gospels was not historical.
A mere glance at the Old Testament shewed
that, if there was not evidence enough for the miracles
in the New Testament, much less was there for the
miracles in the Old.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before me rose up day by day fresh facts and inferences,
not only demonstrating the insufficiency of the
usual evidence to prove that the miracles were true, but
also indicating a very strong probability that they were
false. Often, as I studied the accounts of a miracle, I
could see it as it were in the act of growing up, watch its
first entrance into the Gospel narrative, note its modest
beginning, its subsequent development: and then I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>forced to give it up. Worst of all, that miracle of
miracles which was most precious to me, the Resurrection
of Christ, began to appear to be supported by the feeblest
evidence of all. I had not at that time learned to distinguish
between the Resurrection of Christ’s material
body and the Resurrection of His Spirit or spiritual body.
Christ’s Resurrection seemed to me therefore in those
days to be either a Resurrection of the material and
tangible body or no Resurrection at all. Now for the
Resurrection of the material body I began to be forced to
acknowledge that I could find no basis of satisfying
testimony. I had heard an anecdote of the Head of some
College of Oxford in old days, how he fell asleep after
dinner in the Combination Room, while the Fellows over
their wine were discussing theology, and presently made
them all start by exclaiming as he awoke, “After all there
is no evidence for the Resurrection of Christ!” I realized
that now, not with a start, but gradually, and with a
growing feeling of deep and wearing anxiety. If the
Resurrection of Christ fell, what was to become of my
faith in Christ?</p>

<p class='c006'>Amid this impending ruin of my old belief I saw one
tower standing firm. It was clear that <i>something</i> had
happened after the death of Christ to make new men of
His disciples. It was clear also that St. Paul had seen
<i>something</i> that had induced him to believe that Christ
had risen from the dead. That which had convinced St.
Paul, an enemy, might very well convince the Apostles,
the devoted followers of Christ. What was this <i>something</i>?
It seemed to me that I ought to try to find out.
Meantime, I determined to adopt the advice I gave you
in my last letter—to stand upon the old ways and look
around me and consider my path before taking another
step. Circumstances had placed me in such a position
that I was not called on to decide whether a clergyman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>could entertain such views as were looming on me, and
remain a clergyman. I was not engaged in any work
directly or indirectly requiring clerical qualifications; and
as far as my affections and sentiments were concerned,
I went heartily with the services of the Church of
England.</p>

<p class='c006'>So I resolved to put aside all theology for two or three
years and to devote myself, during that time, to literary
work of another kind. Meantime, I would retain, as far
as possible, the old religious ways of thought, and, at all
events, the old habits. None the less, I would not give
up the intention of investigating the whole truth about
the Resurrection. That there was some nucleus of truth
I felt quite certain; and even if that truth had been embedded
in some admixture of illusion, what then? Were there
no illusions in the history of science? Were there
no illusions in the history of God’s Revelation of Himself
through the Old and New Testaments? Might it not be
God’s method of Revelation that men should pass through
error to the truth? This line of thought seemed promising,
but I would not at once follow it. I would wait three
years and then work out the question of the influence of
illusion on religious truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>An old college acquaintance, an agnostic, whom I met
about this time, was not a little startled when I told him
my thoughts. He frankly informed me that, though I
was “placed in a painful position,” I was “bound to speak
out.” I also thought that I was “bound to speak out”;
but I did not feel bound to obtrude immature views upon
the world, with the result perhaps of afterwards altering
or recanting them. So I took time, plenty of time; I
looked about me, on life as well as on books; I formed a
habit of testing assumptions and asking the meaning of
common words, especially such words as knowledge,
faith, certainty, belief, proof, and the like. Believing that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>theology was made for man and not man for theology, I
began to test theological as well as other propositions by
the question “How do they <i>work</i>?” Meantime I tried
my utmost to do the duties of my daily life without distraction
and with the same energy as before, hoping that
life itself, and the needs of life, would throw some light
upon the question, “What knowledge about God is
necessary for men who are to do their duty? And how
can that knowledge be obtained?”</p>

<p class='c006'>By these means I was led to see that a great part of
what we call knowledge does not come to us, as we falsely
suppose it does, through mere logic or Reason, nor through
unaided experience, but through the emotions and the
Imagination, tested by Reason and experience. Even in
the world of science, I found that the so-called “laws and
properties of matter,” nay, the very existence of matter,
were nothing more than suggestions of the scientific
Imagination aided by experience. A great part of the
environment and development of mankind appeared to
have been directed towards the building up of the imaginative
faculty, without which, it seemed that religion, as well
as poetry, would have been non-existent. So by degrees,
it occurred to me that perhaps I had been on the wrong
track in my search after religious truth. I had been
craving a purely historical and logical proof of Christ’s
divinity, and had felt miserable that I could not obtain it.
But now I perceived that I was not intended to obtain it.
Not thus was Christ to be embraced. There must indeed
be a basis of fact: but after all it was to that imaginative
faculty which we call “faith,” that I must look, at least in
part, for the right interpretation of fact. That Christ
could be apprehended only by faith was a Pauline
common-place; but that Christ’s Resurrection could be
grasped only by faith, and not by the acceptance of
evidence, was, to me, a new proposition. But I gradually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>perceived that it was true. I might be doubtful whether
Thomas touched the side of the risen Saviour, yet sure
that Christ had risen from the dead in the Spirit, and
had manifested Himself after death to His disciples.
My standard of certainty being thus shifted, many things
of which I had formerly felt certain became uncertain;
but, by way of compensation, other things—and these
the most necessary and vital became more certain
than ever. I felt less inclined to dogmatize about the
existence of matter; but my soul was imbued with a
fuller conviction of the existence of a God; and deeper
still became the feeling that, so far as things are known
to me, there is nothing in heaven or earth more divine
than Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus at last light dawned upon my darkness; and when
the sun rose once more upon me, it was the same sun as
before, only more clearly seen above the mists of illusion
which had before obscured it. The old beliefs of my
youth and childhood remained or came back to me, exhibiting
Jesus of Nazareth as the Incarnate Son of God,
the Eternal Word triumphant over death, seated at the
right hand of the Father in heaven, the source of life and
light to all mankind. Like Christian in <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>,
I found myself suddenly freed from a great burden—a
burden of doubts, and provisos, and conditions which,
in old days, had seemed to forbid me from accepting
Jesus as the Lord and Saviour of mankind unless I could
strain my conscience to accept as true a number of stories
many of which I almost certainly knew to be false. In
order to believe in Christ, it was now no longer needful
to believe in suspensions of the laws of Nature: on the
contrary, all Nature seemed to combine to prepare the
way to conform humanity to that image of God which
was set forth in the Incarnation. I did not, as some
Christians do, ignore the existence of Satan (and almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>of sin) which Christ Himself most clearly recognized;
but I seemed to see that evil was being gradually subordinated
to good, and falsehood made the stepping-stone
to truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Through evil to good; through sin to a righteousness
higher than could have been attained save through sin;
through falsehood to the truth; through superstition to
religion—this seemed to me the divine evolution discernible
in the light that was shed from the cross of Christ.
No longer now did it seem impossible or absurd that the
Gospel of the Truth might have been temporarily
obscured by illusions or superstitions even in the earliest
times.</p>

<p class='c006'>I think it must be now some ten years since I settled
down to the belief that the history of Christianity had
been the history of profound religious truth, contained
in, and preserved by, illusions; an ascent of worship
through illusion to the truth. A belief that has been
fifteen years in making, and for ten years more has been
reviewed, criticized, and finally retained as being historically
true and spiritually healthful, you must not call, I
think, “a transient phase”. But I forgive you the
expression. A dozen pages of autobiography are a
sufficient penalty for three offending words.</p>

  <h2 id='let03' class='c004'>III <br /> KNOWLEDGE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>You ask me to explain, in detail, what I mean by
asserting that the Imagination is the basis of knowledge.
“Apparently,” you say, “our knowledge of the world external
to ourselves seems to you to spring, not from the
sensations as interpreted by the Reason, but (at all events
to a large extent) from the sensations as interpreted by the
Imagination. If you mean this, I wish you would show
how the Imagination thus builds up our knowledge of
the world. But I think I must have misunderstood you.”</p>

<p class='c006'>You have not misunderstood me. I would go even
further than the limits of your statement: for I believe
that we are largely indebted to the Imagination for our
knowledge, not only of the external world, but also of
ourselves. However, suppose we first take a simple
instance of the knowledge of external things: “This
inkstand is hard. How did I come to know that it was
hard? How do I know that it is hard now?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us begin from the beginning. I am an infant
scrambling on the floor where the said inkstand is casually
lying. Having a congenital impulse (commonly called
“instinct”) to touch and suck anything that comes in my
way, and especially anything bright, I greedily and rapidly
approximate my lips to the corner of this polished object.
I recoil with a sharp shock of pain. The pain abates.
The instinctive recoil from the inkstand has left in me an
instinctive aversion to the pain-causing object: but my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>touching and sucking instinct again revives, and as soon
as it prevails over the recoiling instinct, I am impelled
again towards the inkstand, not so rapidly as before, but
still too rapidly. I recoil again, with pain lessened but
still acute. I am acquiring “knowledge”: I “know,”
though I cannot put it into words, that I have twice found
the inkstand not-to-be-rapidly-approached-under-penalty-of-a-certain-kind-of-pain,
in other words, “hard.” But I
try again; I try four, five, six times: I find that when I
approach with less velocity my pain is less, and when with
sufficiently diminished velocity, there is no pain at all; I
touch and suck in peace: but when I forget my experience
and suppose that the inkstand—even though I dash wildly
at it after my old fashion—will “behave differently this
time,” I find that I am mistaken: the inkstand will not
“behave differently”; it always behaves in the same
way. By this time then I know something very important
indeed.</p>

<p class='c006'>But pause now, my friend, and ask yourself how much
this infant has a right to say he “knows,” so far as the
evidence of the senses guides him. All that the senses
have told him is that on five, six, seven, say even seventy,
occasions, he found the inkstand hard. But is this all
that he “knows”? You know perfectly well that he knows
infinitely more: he has made a leap from the past into
the future and knows that the inkstand <i>will</i> be found hard
whenever he touches it. When he grows up and attains
the power of speech he will generally express his knowledge
in the Present Tense: “I must not strike the inkstand
with my mouth for it <i>is</i> hard”: but in reality this
“is” implies “will be”; “I must not strike the inkstand
with my mouth for I <i>shall find</i> it hard.” Now what is it
that has produced in him this conviction which no philosopher
can justify by mere logic, but which every baby
acts on? It seems to have arisen thus. The baby has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>received in rapid succession two sensations, first, that of a
violent approximation to the inkstand, secondly, a sudden
shock of pain. Having received this pair of sensations
very frequently, he cannot help associating them together
in his thoughts; so that now the thought of a violent
approximation to the inkstand necessarily suggests to him
the thought that it is not-to-be-approached-violently, or
“hard.” He began by learning to expect that perhaps, or
probably, the first sensation would be followed by the
second; but having found, after constant experiments,
that the second sensation, so far as his experience goes,
always follows the first, he gradually passes from belief
into certainty, or knowledge, that the second always
will, or must, follow the first.</p>

<p class='c006'>A similar transition is going on at the same time in the
infant’s mind—I mean the transition from belief to certainty—in
regard to thousands of other propositions besides the
one we have selected, “this inkstand is hard.” Every
single case of such transition facilitates the transition in
other cases, by making the child feel that, if he is to get
on in the world and make his way through it without incurring
the constant pains and penalties of Nature, he
must not disregard these juxtapositions, or pairs of sensations,
(which, when he grows older, he will, if ever he
becomes an educated man, call “cause” and “effect”),
but must take them to heart and remember them; when
the first of a familiar pair comes, he must be prepared to
find the second immediately following. Not unfrequently
the child’s limited experience associates together in his
mind sensations that Nature has not associated; as, for
example, when he infers that a clock must tick because
he has never yet in his life seen a clock that has stopped.
In this and other cases the child has afterwards to dissociate
what he had too hastily joined together, and to
correct his conclusions by wider experience. But, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>whole, the transition from belief to certainty, in any one
case, is facilitated by the great majority of similar cases
in which the same transition is going on with results that
are confirmed by his own experience and by that of his
elders. What helps the transition, in each case, is its
general success; it <i>works</i>: it helps the child to move
more and more confidently in the world without subjecting
himself to the punishments which Nature has attached to
ignorance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now therefore, reviewing the stages of the progress
upwards, we see that the knowledge of which we are
speaking is based upon an inherent and fundamental
belief of which we can give no logical justification whatever.
Why should an inkstand always be hard? The
child can allege no reason for this except that, having
found the inkstand to be hard in a great number of past
instances, he is compelled to believe that it will be always
hard, with such a force of conviction that he cannot but
feel and say he “knows” it. But of course there is no
logical justification for this assertion. He might argue
for some months or even years, in precisely the same way
about a clock, and say that “a clock always ticks,” because
he has seen the clock tick times innumerable and never
known it not to tick. Why should not a larger experience
confute his so-called knowledge in the case of the inkstand
as in the case of the clock? As the clock collapses,
why should not the nature of the inkstand collapse—be,
come unwound, so to speak, or altogether transmuted?
There is no possible answer to this question for the
child, at present, except the following:—“It never has
done so, and therefore I believe that it never will. I
believe in the uniformity of Nature. The sequences of
observed cause and effect are Nature’s promises, and if
she does not keep them, life will break down. I am compelled
to believe, and to act on the belief, that life will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>not break down. I believe that this inkstand is hard,
because this belief <i>works</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I conclude therefore that all knowledge of the kind we
are now describing is based on belief (viz. the belief that
what has been will be) tested by experience. I think it
must also be admitted that Imagination contributed to the
result: for the child not only remembers his two past
consecutive sensations but gradually <i>images</i> in his mind a
kind of bond between them, which memory pure and
simple could not have contributed. Memory reproduces
“Inkstand and <i>then</i> hardness;” Imagination paints, or
begins to paint, a new idea, “Inkstand and <i>therefore</i> hardness.”
Again, Memory reproduces vaguely numerous instances,
“The inkstand was hard ten, eleven, twenty,
many times;” then comes Imagination and at a leap
sets before the mind an entirely new notion, and invents
for it the word “always.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Concerning other and more complex kinds of knowledge
what need is there to say a word? For if such simple
propositions as “a stone is hard,” are shown to depend
upon Imagination for suggesting, and Faith for retaining,
a conviction of the uniformity of Nature, much more must
these influences be presupposed if the child is to attain
knowledge about matters avowedly future, <i>e.g.</i> “the sun
will rise to-morrow.” In reality all knowledge of any
practical value has to do with a future, immediate or
remote; and therefore I do not think I shall be exaggerating
in saying that for all knowledge about things outside
us we depend largely upon Imagination and Faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>But I pass now to consider a child’s knowledge about
himself. Take for example such a proposition as this,
“I like sugar.” Is Faith or Imagination required to enable
a child to arrive at the knowledge of this proposition
about himself? I think so. The very use of the word
“I,” if used intelligently, appears to need some imaginative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>effort. Of course I do not deny that this subtle
metaphysical idea may have been suggested to us originally
by our faculty of touch, and especially the faculty
of self-pinching or self-touching. I dare say you have
read how men have sometimes caught hold of their own
benumbed hand by night, and awakened a household
by shouting that they had caught a robber: has it ever
occurred to you that, if you never had the power of distinguishing
your own hand from anybody else’s hand by
the sense of touch, you might have gone through life with
no sense, or with a very tardily acquired sense, of your
own identity? If the monkey who boiled his own tail in
the caldron had felt no pain, might he not have been
excused for doubting sometimes whether the tail belonged
to him? And if his head were equally painless or
joyless when he thumped it or scratched it, ought he to be
condemned for disowning his own head? And if a
monkey, or even a child, could not lay claim to its own
head, it seems to me doubtful whether he could ever claim
such a separation from the outside world as would necessitate
his using the word “I.” But, as it is, having this
self-pinching faculty, the child soon finds that to pinch a
ball, or a bladder, or a sister, is an entirely different thing
from pinching himself: and this self-touching faculty confirms
the evidence suggested by the bumps and thumps
of the external world; all of which lead him to the belief
that he has a bodily frame of his own, liable to pain and
to pleasure, and largely dependent for pain and pleasure
on his own motions, which motions he dimly perceives
dependent upon something that appears to be inside
himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>But neither this nor any other explanation of the
manner in which the sensations prepare the way for the
construction of the idea of the “I,” ought to prevent us
from recognizing that the idea itself is the work of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Imagination, and not of the unaided sensations, nor of the
unaided reason. Self-pinching and contact with the rough
external world might convince the child that he was different
from his environment at the time when he made his
last experiments and underwent his last experiences; but
they could not convince him that he <i>is</i> different <i>now</i>, or
that he <i>will be</i> different in the next instant; and for this
conviction he depends upon faith. Again, the imagination
of the “I” seems closely bound up with two other nearly
simultaneous imaginations, those of Force and Cause.
First he feels a desire to touch the inkstand, then he feels
himself moving towards the inkstand, then he feels the
inkstand touched. These sequences of desire, action,
result, he can repeat as often as he likes. By their frequency
therefore, as well as by their vividness, they
impress him more powerfully than sequences of phenomena
not dependent on himself; and it is from these
probably that he first imagines the idea of “must,” or
“necessity,” or “cause and effect.” If he feels a desire to
move a limb, the motion of the limb immediately follows;
it always obeys him; it <i>must</i> obey him. He pushes a
brick; what caused the brick to fall? He feels that it
was his own force that caused it; he no longer looks upon
the push and the fall as if the former merely preceded
the latter; he imagines a connection of necessity between
the push and the fall, the cause and the effect, and gradually
comes to imagine himself as the causer of the cause.
But all these imaginations are mere imaginations, not
proofs. To gather together all the sensations of which
he retains the memory, the sensations of which he is at
present conscious, and the sensations to which he looks
forward, and to put an “I” behind or below all these, as
the foundation of them all, and partial causer of them all—what
an audacious assumption is this! Not Plato and
Aristotle combined could prove to a child, or to the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>consummate of philosophers, that he has a right to call
himself “I,” or that he is any other than a machine and a
part of the universal machinery. How can I prove and
vindicate my independence, my right to an “I”? By saying
that I will do, or not do, and by then doing, or not doing,
any conceivable thing at any conceivable time? Such
an attempt is futile. The retort is unanswerable: “In the
great machine which you call the universe, that small
part which you call ‘I’ was so constructed and wound
up that it could no more help saying and doing what
it did and said, than a clock could help pointing and
striking.”</p>

<p class='c006'>What then is the real proof that we are right in using
the word “I” and in distinguishing ourselves from other
objects which we call external? There is no proof at all
except that, first, we are led to this way of looking at
things by Nature and Imagination, and secondly, this way
of looking at things <i>works</i> best. The “I-view” is better
fitted than the “machine-view” to develop in us the
faculties of judgment and self-control, to give us a sense
of responsibility and a capability of amendment, and to
make us ultimately more hopeful and more active. So
too, the belief in “cause and effect” <i>works</i> better than a
mere mental record of past antecedents and sequences,
accompanied by a blank and strictly logical neutrality of
mind as to what will happen in the future. Faith in
“cause and effect” is the foundation of all stable life and
all regular progress alike in the individual and in the
state. The unfaithful unbeliever in causality is the Esau,
both in the moral and in the intellectual world, the happy-go-lucky
hunter who depends on stray venison and refuses
to resort to system in order to make a sure provision
for the needs of the future; the believer is the quiet plodding
Jacob who has his goats in the fold where he knows
he can find them when wanted. The unbeliever is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>unimaginative savage who has not faith enough to see the
harvest in the seed; the believer is the man of civilisation
who can trust Nature through six long months of waiting
and can say to her, not in the language of hope, “<i>do ut
des</i>,” but in the language of conviction, “<i>do daturae</i>.”
Nevertheless, convenient as these ideas may be for our
comfort, nay, though they may be even necessary for our
existence, we are bound to recollect that they are merely
ideas. Like the ideas of force, cause, effect, necessity,
so the idea of “I,”—though produced with the aid of
experience and tested by appeal to experience and reason—appears
to be nothing but a child of the Imagination,
and a foster-child of Faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps your conclusion from all this is that I am
proving that we can know nothing? Not in the least.
What I am saying does not prove that we know less or
more than we profess to know at present. I am merely
showing that our knowledge comes to us from sources
other than those which are ordinarily assumed.</p>
<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='let04' class='c004'>IV <br /> IDEALS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>You ask me to pass to the consideration of
knowledge of a new kind, knowledge of mathematical
truth. “Here at least,” you say, “severe reasoning
dominates supreme, and Imagination has no place.”
“Two and one make three,” “The angles at the base of
an isosceles triangle are equal:” “surely we may assume
that Imagination has nothing to do with these propositions.
They must be decided by pure Reason.” Never
was assumption more grotesque. Excuse me; but by what
other adjective can I characterize the statement that the
Imagination has “nothing to do with” propositions for
the very terms of which we are indebted to the Imagination?
I maintain without fear of contradiction that the
knowledge of these propositions requires an effort of the
Imagination so severe that the very young and the
completely untrained cannot attain to it.</p>

<p class='c006'>For, in the first place, what do you mean by “one,”
“two,” and “three”? I have never had any experience
of such things; nor have you; nor can you. “Two”
oranges, “two” apples, and the like, we have had
experience of, and can realize; but to think of “one” or
“two” by themselves (“one” or “two” with “anythings”,
or with “nothings” after them), “one” or “two” as
“abstract ideas”—this really is a most difficult or rather
(I am inclined to say) an impossible task. When I say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“one” and “two,” I think I see before me dimly “one”
or “two” dots or small strokes, and I perceive that two
and one of these dots or strokes make up three dots or
strokes. When I speak of “twenty” and “thirty,” I do
not see any images of these existences; and when I
say that “twenty” and “thirty” make “fifty,” I do not
realize the process of addition at all visibly; I merely
repeat the statement on the authority of previous observations
and reasonings mostly made by others and not by
myself. But so far as I approximate to the realization of
an abstract number, I do it by a kind of negative imagination.
And in any case we can hardly deny that all
arithmetical propositions, since they employ terms that
denote mere imaginary ideas, must be regarded as based
on the imagination.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is the same with Geometry. The whole of what we
call “Euclid” is based upon a most aerial effort of the
Imagination. We have to imagine lines without thickness,
straightness that does not deviate the billionth part
of an inch from perfect evenness, perfectly symmetrical
circles, and—climax of audacity!—points that have “no
parts and no magnitude!” Obviously these things have
no existence except in the dreams of Imagination; yet
Euclid’s severe reasoning applies to none but these things.
If you step from your ideal triangle in Dreamland into
your material triangle in chalk-land, you step from absolute
truth into statements that are not absolutely true.
The angles at the base of your chalk isosceles triangle
are not exactly equal, if you measure them with sufficient
accuracy. In a word the whole of Geometry is an appeal
to the Imagination in which the geometer says to us, “I
know that my propositions are not exactly true except
with respect to invisible, ideal, and imaginary figures,
planes, and solids. These ideas, therefore, you must
endeavour to imagine. In order to relieve the strain on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>your imagination, I will place before you material and
visible figures about which my reasoning will be approximately
true. From these I must ask you to try to
rise upward to the imagination of their archetypes, the
immaterial realities.”</p>

<p class='c006'>What shall we reply to our overbearing mathematician
who in this abrupt and audacious manner introduces the
non-existent and imaginary creatures of his brain as
being “realities”? Shall we deride him, and the arithmetician
likewise? Shall we bid the latter exchange his
calculations in abstract numbers for manifestly useful
sums about sacks of wheat and casks of beer? Shall we
bid the mathematician descend from his high geometrical
theories to the practical measurements of agriculture?
Pouring scorn on his avowal that the objects of his
reasoning are “invisible, ideal, and imaginary,” shall we
decline to study a science that is confessedly—so we can
word it—visionary and illusive? If we do, he will not be
without a reply, somewhat after this fashion: “My
practical friends, it will be the worse for you if you
despise these invisible, ideal and imaginary objects. I
say nothing about the mental training and development
to be derived from the study of these things; for to this
argument you do not appear to me to be at present
accessible: but I will take your own line—the practical.
Do you then want to measure your fields with ease and to
make accurate maps and charts; to construct houses that
shall stand longer, ships that shall sail faster, cannon that
shall shoot further, engines that shall pull harder, than
any known before; do you want to utilize electricity for
lighting, gas for motion, water for pressure; in a word do
you wish to make yourselves lords over the material
world and to have all the forces of Nature at your beck
and call? If you do, you must not despise the non-existent
numbers of my arithmetical brother, nor my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>immaterial and imaginary lines. Give me leave to repeat,
in spite of your indignation, that though they are (in this
present visible world of ours) non-existent, yet these lines
and numbers are ‘realities.’ That they are realities, and
that our conclusions about them are real and true, is
proved by the one test of truth: our conclusions <i>work</i>.
Our discoveries are in harmony with the universe. A
perfect circle you never saw and never will see: yet it is
as real as a beefsteak and a pint of porter. I believe in
a perfect circle by Faith; I accept it with reverence as
an impression, if I may so dare to speak, on the Mind of
the Universe, which He has communicated to me. What
is more, I believe that He intended us to study this and
other immaterial realities that our minds might approximate
to His. Take a cone, my practical friends. What
do you see in it? Nothing, I fear, except a shape that
reminds you of an extinguisher or a fool’s cap. Yet this
little solid contains within itself the suggestions of all
the mysteries of motion in heaven and earth. Slice your
cone parallel to the base: there you have the perfect
circle. Slice it again, parallel to one of the sides: there
you have the parabola, the curve of terrestrial motion.
Slice it once more, midway between these two sections:
there you have the ellipse, the curve of celestial motion
for which all the astronomers were seeking in vain
through something like a score of centuries. Seriously
now, my half-educated friends, in spite of the sense you
may for the most part entertain of your own importance,
do you not in your more modest moods sometimes feel
inclined to say that, ‘A circle is, after all, a reality,
perhaps more real than I am myself’?”</p>

<p class='c006'>What do you think of all this? For my part, I am
inclined to think the Mathematician has the best of it.
A good deal will turn upon the meaning of that dangerous
word “reality,” about which I will give you my notions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>perhaps, hereafter.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a> But even if you dispute his assertions
about the reality of his “ideas,” you cannot, I am sure,
deny the immense practical importance, as well as the
universal acceptance, of his conclusions and discoveries;
and you will do well to remember that this immensely
important, this undisputed and indisputable knowledge,
could never have been attained if we had not called in the
Imagination to create for us ideas that never will be, and
never can be, realised in this present material world.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us pass now from knowledge about things to knowledge
about persons, <i>i.e.</i> about actions and motives.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our knowledge about actions depends on (1) personal
observation; (2) testimony; (3) circumstantial evidence
or any combination of these three.</p>

<p class='c006'>The knowledge that we derive of actions from our own
observation is of course independent of Faith, so far as
concerns the past; but it is very limited, and entirely
useless and unpractical, except as a basis for knowledge
about the present and future; for which knowledge (as we
have seen) Faith in the permanence of Nature is absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>The knowledge of actions that comes to us from
evidence, direct and circumstantial, is largely dependent
on Faith. “Julius Cæsar invaded Britain”—how certain
we all feel of that! Yet how slight the testimony!
Simply a few pages of narrative, written by the supposed
invader himself, and some casual remarks by one or two
contemporary letter-writers about Cæsar’s doings in
Britain and the Senate’s reception of the news. Why
should we believe on so apparently flimsy a basis? Why
should not Cæsar have sent one of his lieutenants to invade
the island, and afterwards have taken the credit of
it himself? Or there might have been no invasion at all,
nothing but a reconnaissance grossly exaggerated and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>intermixed with facts derived from travellers. Yet we
believe in the invasion without the slightest hesitation.
Cæsar, we say, would not have told the lie; or, if he had,
it would have been quickly exposed by his enemies. In
other words, we believe in the truth of the narrative,
because a belief in its falsehood does not “work,” that
is to say, does not suit with what we know (or, more properly,
with what others know) of Cæsar’s character and
Cæsar’s times. Of precisely the same kind is almost all
our knowledge about history: it is based upon evidence,
but it is belief; and the only test of its truth is, does it
“work,” <i>i.e.</i> does it fit in with other knowledge which we
regard as established truth?</p>

<p class='c006'>But you see that, even in dealing with a simple action of
Cæsar’s, we have already drifted into a reference to Cæsar’s
motives: and obviously knowledge about “motives” is
an important and indeed a paramount element in knowledge
about persons. “My father,” says the child, “has
his brows knit; his face looks dark; he speaks very loud;
his eyes look brighter than usual:”—this is knowledge
about actions derived from personal observation, but, so
far, perfectly useless, until something is added to it.
“Whenever my father has looked and spoken like this
before, he has been angry and has punished somebody:
therefore he is angry and will punish somebody now”—this
is not knowledge, it is only belief; but it is belief not
about actions simply, but about motives as well as actions,
and it may be of the greatest use.</p>

<p class='c006'>How do we gain knowledge about motives, the moving
powers of the human machine? Since we cannot take
this machinery to pieces, or experiment with it freely, we
must derive our knowledge largely from the consciousness
of our own motives. Tickling produces laughter in us,
and pricking, a cry; affection, and the command of those
whom we love, produce in us obedience; desire of a result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>or reward produces effort; fear of pain or penalty produces
avoidance of certain actions, performance of others.
Hence we infer that, in others also, similar effects have
been produced, or will be produced, by similar causes.
In either case, our inference is based partly upon our
observation that these causes have preceded these effects
in other persons, and partly upon our <i>faith</i> that other
people’s machinery is like our own.</p>

<p class='c006'>But we have not yet touched one of the most powerful
of motives, that power within us which we call Conscience
(“joint-knowledge”); as though there were in us an
Assessor sitting in judgment by the side of the mysterious
“I,” the two together pronouncing sentence of “Right”
or “Wrong” upon the several propositions and intentions
which are, as it were, called up before their tribunal.
The development of Conscience and our sensibility to its
dictation appears to me largely due to the Imagination.
If a philosopher tells me that when Conscience appears
to us to say “Right” it really says “Expedient for
society and ultimately for yourself,” or “Calculated to
gain esteem for yourself,” or “Conducive to your own
peace of mind,” I am obliged, with all deference to him,
but with greater deference to truth, to assure him that
(however correct he may be as to the origin of this feeling
in my own infant mind or in the matured mind of my
primæval ancestors) he is mistaken, at all events in my own
case, as to the action of Conscience now. I may possibly
have been long ago guided to my idea of “Right” by
my observation of what is expedient: but, to me, now, the
sense of “right” is as different from the sense of “expedient,”
as the eye is different from some sensitive
protuberance which may ultimately be developed into an
eye, but is at present responsive only to the touch.</p>

<p class='c006'>How then do we gain this knowledge of right and
wrong? For of course it is not enough to reply that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>gain it by the voice of Conscience: such an answer only
makes us repeat our question in a different shape: “In the
very young, Conscience, though it may be existent, is certainly
latent; when and whence does it begin to work?”
I should reply that the first idea of good and evil is communicated
to the very young through the habit of obedience
to their parents or those who stand to them in
the parental position. A child is so created as to be in
constant dependence on the favour and good-will of his
mother. When he is obedient to her he finds himself at
peace and happy, and he welcomes on her face that sunshine
which indicates that she is pleased with him. When
he is disobedient, harsh sounds follow, a lowering darkness
on the countenance close to his, obstacles to his
freedom, restrictions of his pleasures, perhaps sharper
pains or penalties: and he is now out of harmony with
his little Universe. All this strange and subtle evil inside
him and outside him he has brought on himself by disobeying
the maternal will; and hence there gradually
springs up in his mind an Imagination of some unnameable
thing, which is his first idea of right. But as he
grows older and widens his sphere of observation he
finds—if he is placed in anything like those favourable
circumstances which Nature has appointed for most of
us—that this parental will is in harmony with the widening
world around him. The parents say, “Do not play
with fire;” Nature says the same, and punishes him if
he transgresses. The parents say, “Do not touch that
knife;” again Nature confirms their authority by inflicting
a penalty on disobedience. Thus, if the parents have
anything of parental forethought, the child gradually
associates them with the governing powers of his growing
Universe, and begins to feel that the parental will is also
the will, or order, of Nature. They are as God to him:
and the confirmed habit of obedience to them deepens in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>his heart the conviction—but still a conviction rather
springing from Imagination than from Reason—that the
power which thus induces him to obey is a great and
grand Power, orderly, not to be resisted; wise and
justified by results, but to be obeyed without thinking
about results; it <i>ought</i> to be obeyed; it is <i>Right</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now he steps out into the world of other human
beings; and here he learns to widen his idea of Right.
Perhaps he also learns to alter it. If he was born and
reared among thieves, his conscience may have been altogether
perverted so that he actually thought it honourable
to steal. But in any case, even though he may come from
the best of homes, he often learns that the parental will
is not always in harmony with the highest and best will;
and gradually he forms a different standard of “Right”
from that which he held before. It was once the will of
his parents, now it is often the will of Society. Conforming
himself to the will of Society he is free from pains and
penalties; he is at peace with those around him, and he
is generally at peace with himself. I say generally, not
always: for by this time he has begun to think for himself
and to see that Conscience ought to speak in the interests
not merely of his parents, nor of a select circle of his own
friends or companions, but of all mankind. His Imagination
pictures for him an ideal Order such as he has never
actually experienced. He feels that he “ought” to be
at peace and in harmony with this imaginary Order, and
not with some distorted and narrowed conception of it
conveyed to him by his “set,” his class, his city, his
nation, or his church. In his conscience, he hears the
voice of this Moral Order of humanity. Hence it is
that men have been sometimes impelled to thoughts
beyond, or even against, the conscience of their contemporaries;
to protest, for example, against unjust wars,
against war of any kind, against slavery, against duelling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>against legalized oppression. In every case the impelling
power has been the same, a sense of discord between the
man’s imaginary ideal and the actual environment in
which these evils and disorders have existed. Others, his
commonplace companions, have been content to go with the
world around them—to be kind slave-holders, honourable
duellists, moderate oppressors—and they have felt no
pangs of conscience. But by a few, a chosen few, there
has been acquired a keener sense of the ideal of moral
harmony, a keener eye for detecting moral disorder, and
an abhorrence of it which will not permit them to live in
peace amid such evils: they must either die or mend
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>They often do die in mending them; but while in the
process of dying, or preparing for death—with all deference
to the clergyman who lately maintained that “if
there is no hereafter, and if the only reward of self-sacrifice
and the only punishment of crime are those which
happen in the present life, <i>it would have been far better to
have been Fouché than Paul</i>”—they have at least a peace
of mind which they could not have attained by conformity
with the world. The grosser conscience that “worked”
well enough in their companions would not have “worked”
in them. Even, therefore, though they appear to be exceptions
to the rule that tests truth by its “working,”
they are not really exceptional. They have been in
discord with the world but in concord with themselves.
Often they prove to others the truth of their conceptions
by raising up the world to their level, and by pointing to
the moral order which has issued from the fulfilment of
their ideas. But in any case, though they may fail for
a time or (apparently) for all time, they have had in
themselves a sufficient test of the truth of their ideas:
they have followed their conscience and they have found
that this course “worked”—that is to say, suited and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>developed their nature—as no other course could have
worked for them. But in order thus to hear and obey the
voice of conscience and to discern its highest truths,
how much of faith, how much of imagination has been
needed!</p>

<p class='c006'>But this digression about Conscience has led me a little
astray from my subject, which was “the knowledge of
persons:” I must return to it in my next letter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h2 id='let05' class='c004'>V <br /> IDEALS AND TESTS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us now return to the consideration of the
“knowledge of persons.” How do we gain knowledge of
a human being, that is to say of his motives? “By observing
his actions in many different circumstances, especially
in extremities of joy, sorrow, fear, temptation, and then by
comparing his actions with what we, or others, have done
in the same circumstances?” But this is a very difficult
and delicate business, especially that part of it which
involves comparison. Here we may easily go wrong;
and we therefore naturally ask what test have we that
our knowledge is correct. One test of any useful knowledge
of a machine would be, not our power to discourse
fluently about it, but our power to “work” it, <i>i.e.</i> to make
it perform the work for which it is intended: and similarly
one test of useful knowledge of a human being must be
our power to “work” him, <i>i.e.</i> to make him perform the
work for which he is intended. A perfectly selfish man
of the world may have considerable knowledge of men
and “work” them cleverly in a certain sense: he is not
cheated by them; he is perhaps obeyed by some, not
thwarted by others; he knows the weak points of all,
jostles down one, persuades another to lift him up, gets
something out of every one, and is, in a word, largely
successful in making men help him to do <i>what he intends</i>.
But this is a very poor kind of “working,” as
compared with that which has been practised by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>lawgivers, poets, philosophers, and founders of religion;
who have moulded and fashioned great masses of men so
as to be better able than they were before to do the noblest
works that men can do, the works for <i>which they are
intended</i>. Now I think it will not be denied that the men
who, in this sense, have “worked” mankind have had
great ideas of what men could do and ought to do.
Sometimes they have had ideas so high that they have
seemed impossible of attainment and almost absurd, even
as ideas. Yet these are the men, these idealizers of humanity,
who have most helped mankind on the path of progress.
And this would lead us to the conclusion that the
men who have “worked” mankind best have been those
who have refused to accept men as they are. Constrained
by the Imagination, they have kept before their eyes an
Ideal of humanity, towards which they have aspired and
laboured with sanguine enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c006'>To the same effect tends our observation of mankind
in smaller groups, and especially in that smallest of
groups called the family. It is generally the parents who
have most influence over their child, most power to
“work” him; and we can often see that the reason of
their influence does not arise from the power to reward or
punish, but from their affection for him, and from their
faith in him. Especially do we perceive this in the
familiar but mysterious process called forgiving. We
see parents, yes even wise parents, constantly placing
faith in a child beyond what seems to a dispassionate observer
to be warranted by facts, treating him as though
he were better than he has shewn himself to be, better
than he appears to us likely ever to become. And,
strange to say, this imaginative system has on the whole
proved more successful than the impartial and dispassionate
disposition which would take a human being exactly
for what he is, and treat him as being that and no more.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>I do not mean to say that there have not been blind and
fond parents in abundance who—having no high moral
standard and being merely desirous to see comfort and
bright faces around them—have done their children harm
by ignoring their faults and regarding them as perfect: but
on the other hand, I call on you to admit the paradox that
just, wise, and righteous parents, who have had a high
moral standard, have been most successful in enabling
their child to rise to that standard, by treating him as
though he were better than he really has been. Further,
I say that this system has been pursued by all those who
have forgiven others, and by Him above all others who
has done most to make forgiveness “current coin”
among mankind.</p>

<p class='c006'>I can understand a man of cold-blooded and dispassionate
temperament objecting to any such idealization of
humanity. “The whole theory,” he might say, “is radically
unfair and unreasonable. You argue that you ought to
love a man and ignore his faults if you wish to know him
and move him. You might just as well argue that you
ought to hate a man and ignore his virtues for the same
purpose. Hate is as keen-eyed as love. Hate spies out
the least defects, anticipates each false step, predicts each
hasty word, and caricatures beforehand each hasty gesture.
Hate makes a study of its objects: hate, therefore, as
well as love, might be said to stimulate us to know others.
But the right course is neither to hate, nor to love, but to
judge. As hate blinds us to virtues, so love blinds us to
vices. We ought to be blind to nothing, to extenuate nothing,
to ignore nothing, but to be purely and reasonably
critical. Thus we shall know humanity as it is.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The answer to this very plausible theory is extremely
simple: “Your theory appears to be just and wise upon a
cursory and unscientific view of human nature: but it
has not endured the scientific test of experiment; it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>not <i>worked</i>. I believe the reason why it does not work is,
that it ignores some faintly discernible but growing tendencies
in human nature which are not to be discerned
without more sympathy than you appear to possess: no
human being can be understood in the daylight of Reason
alone; affection and Imagination are needed to transport
us as it were into the heart of a fellow-creature, to enable
us to realize him as we realize ourselves, and to treat him
as we would ourselves be treated; faith also in the possibilities
of humanity is a very powerful help not only
towards discerning the best and noblest that men can do,
but also towards developing their power of doing it. But
in any case, whatever may be the reasons for its failure,
your theory does not ‘work,’ and must therefore be
given up.</p>

<p class='c006'>“By ‘failure,’ I do not mean that your theory will
prevent you from getting on and making your way in the
world, but that it will prevent you from operating on yourself
and on mankind, so that you and they may do the
work which you are intended to do. You say the business
of a student of men is to be critical. I say that such a
student is a mere pedant, a book-philosopher: but the
scientific student of men is he who knows how to ‘work’
them: and those who have in the true sense of the term
‘worked’ men, have not been of the critical temperament
which you eulogize, but often quite uncritical, wondrously
uncritical, but full of a fervent faith in a high ideal of
humanity, and in a destiny that would ultimately conform
humanity to its ideal. If you aim at exerting no social
ennobling influence of this kind, if you are content, while
leading the life of a man of the world, to abide, spiritually
speaking, in the cave of a recluse, then keep on your present
course. Criticize men dispassionately to your heart’s
content. Try to persuade yourself that you know them.
But you will never succeed—you will never persuade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>even yourself that you have succeeded—in making a
single human being the better for your influence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In morals as in mathematics nothing can be done
without faith in the Ideal. If you want to operate scientifically
upon imperfect men you must keep constantly
before your mind the image of the Perfect Man. We have
seen that, before we can attain to ‘applied mathematics,’
which constitute the basis of those sciences by which we
dominate the material world, we have to begin with ‘pure
mathematics.’ In that region of study we have to idealize
and speak of things, not as they are in our experience,
but as they might be if certain tendencies that we see
around us could be infinitely—yes, and we must add,
impossibly—extended. Yet in the end, if we go patiently
onward, we find that our ‘pure mathematics’ lead us to
conclusions of immense practical importance.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It is precisely the same in the science of humanity,
which we may call anthropology. In order to prepare
the way for ‘applied anthropology’ whereby we may
dominate the immaterial world, the minds and tempers
of men, we must begin with ‘pure anthropology’; that is
to say, we must idealize and speak of man not as he is but
as he would be if certain tendencies which we see in him,
conducive to social order and individual development,
could be infinitely—yes, and we must add, if we limit
our horizon to this present life, impossibly—extended.
In the end, if we go patiently onward, we shall find that
‘pure anthropology’ will be of immense practical importance
in helping us to control and develop ourselves and
individuals around us and all communities of men. This
‘pure anthropology,’ having to do with the Ideal of
humanity, is necessarily associated or identified with the
conception of God; and some would call it ‘theology’ or
‘Christianity.’ But that is a mere matter of names. Call
it by whatever name you please, but study it you must.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>You will never ‘work’ mankind—that is to say you will
never make men do the work for which they are intended—till
you have studied the Ideal Man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>You may reply, and with some justice, that there is a
danger in this repeated appeal to the test of “working.”
“What,” you may ask, “about the Buddhist and the
Mohammedan, the one with his peaceful missions, the
other with his victorious sword? Cannot both make the
same appeal? In advocating the invariable appeal to
‘working,’ do we not come dangerously near urging the
acceptance of any doctrine that will afford good leverage
to moral effort, regardless of its truth or falsehood?
Ought not, after all, the harmony of the doctrine with
Reason (in the highest sense—not only syllogistic, but
intuitive, imaginative, or whatever you choose to call it)
to be the ultimate criterion?”</p>

<p class='c006'>I suppose there is a “danger” in every means of attaining
truth, a danger in observation, a danger in experiment,
a danger in inductive, a danger in deductive,
reasoning: but it does not follow that any of these means
are to be discarded, only that they are to be carefully
used. If the Buddhist can appeal to the successes of
centuries, that proves, I should say, that there is some
element of genuine truth in his religion; if the Mohammedan
points to conversions, in India and elsewhere, far
more rapid than those made by Christianity and not
dependent on “the victorious sword,” that also proves
that in some important respects for example in the
practical recognition of the equality of all believers
without respect to rank or race—Mohammedans have
been far more faithful to their teacher than we have been
to ours. And generally, any religion that succeeds in
making men better with it than they were without it,
must be admitted (I think) to contain (so far as it succeeds)
some element of divine revelation. And therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>while admitting the appeal to Reason, I cannot reject the
appeal to Experience as well. Do not think that, in
laying so much stress on “working,” I ignore the difference
between the propositions of Natural Science and
those of Religion, or forget how much more ready and
convincing verification is in the former than in the latter.
The means of verifying may differ in different ages: why
not? In the earliest period of Christianity, men had, as
a test, the contrast between the heathen and the Christian
life; the burning zeal of the freshly imparted Spirit of
Christ; and the “mighty works” wrought by the Apostles
and perhaps by some of their successors. Now, for us in
Christendom, the proof from “contrast” is less obvious,
and we have lost also something of the fresh and fiery zeal—must
we not add the occasionally misguided zeal?—of
the first Christians: but by way of compensation, we have,
besides our individual experiences, the collective evidence
of many generations shewing what Christ’s Spirit can do
to help us when we obey it, to chasten us when we disobey.
Are we wrong then in inferring that one test of
religions is the same which our Lord appointed for testing
men: “By their fruits ye shall know them”?</p>

<p class='c006'>There is undoubtedly a great difference between proof
in Science and proof in matters of Religion: and Religion
depends, far more than Science, upon Imagination. But
I have not ignored this difference. On the contrary, I
have attempted to show that, since Religion depends <i>far
more</i> than Science upon Imagination; and since Science
itself depends <i>largely</i> upon Imagination; therefore Religion
must depend <i>very largely</i> upon Imagination, and
especially upon that form of Imagination to which we
give the name of Faith.</p>

  <h2 id='let06' class='c004'>VI <br /> IMAGINATION AND REASON</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>You suspect that I am “pushing the claims of
the Imagination so far as to deprive the Reason or Understanding<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
of its rights;” and you ask me whether I
dispute the universal belief that the former is an “illusive
faculty.” As for your suspicion, I will endeavour to show
that it is groundless. As for your question, I admit that
the Imagination is “illusive,” but I must add that it also
leads us to truth. It constructs the hypotheses, as well as
the illusions, which, when tested by experience, guide us
towards Knowledge.</p>

<p class='c006'>Imagination is the “imaging” faculty of the mind.
It does not, strictly speaking, create, any more than an
artist, strictly speaking, creates. But as an artist combines
lines, colours, shades, sounds, and thoughts, each
one of which by itself is familiar to everybody, in such
new combinations as to produce effects that impress us
all as original and unprecedented, so does the Imagination
out of old fragments make new existences and unities.</p>

<p class='c006'>Attention impresses upon us the present; Memory
recalls the past; but the Imagination is never content
simply to reproduce the past or present. It sums up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>past of Memory (sometimes perhaps also the present of
Attention) and combines it with a conjectured future in
such a way as to produce a whole. It is always seeking
for likenesses, orderly connections, regular sequences,
beautiful relations, suggestions of unity in some shape or
other, so as to reduce many things into one and to obtain
a satisfying picture.</p>

<p class='c006'>For example, suppose a large mill-wheel at rest to
be almost hidden from my eyes by intervening trees so
that, even if it were moving, I could only see one spoke
at a time; and at present I am not aware that it is close
before me. Something begins to move. I look up.
Attention tells me that I see before me, moving from left
to right, something like a plank or pole: it passes and I
see nothing; but then comes another similar object moving
similarly; then a third, rather quicker; then a fourth,
quicker still. The mind at once sets to work to find the
cause. The Memory tells me that I have seen simply a
number of poles or planks moving from left to right with
quickened motion; the Attention tells me that I see one
now; but the Imagination, taking in the isolated reports
of Memory and Attention, includes them in a larger
hypothesis of her own, in which, if I may so express it,
the constituent elements, the spokes, are subordinated,
and the explanatory unity, the wheel, is brought into
prominence; and thus the motion from left to right,
which explained nothing, is replaced, in my mind, by the
motion of revolution, which explains everything.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is on the basis of the Imagination, aided by
Experience and Reason, that we establish our conviction
of the permanence of the simplest Laws of Nature.
This I have touched on in one of my previous letters. The
Memory, recalling the sight of many stones falling to
the ground, comes perhaps to the aid of Attention, as
a child notes a particular stone falling to the ground, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>suggests to the child’s imitative nature an experimental
attempt to make a stone fall to the ground. The child
does it once and again, as often as he likes. Then, as a
result of this unvarying experience, there springs up in
the child’s mind a picture in which he sees reproduced an
apparently endless vista of his sensations as to stone-falling
and its antecedents, a picture not confined, like
the pictures of Memory, to past time, but including
future as well as past and present; and thus the childish
thought leaps upwards all at once to the conception of
that sublime word “always,” and dares to promulgate its
first universal proposition, and attains to the definite
certainty of a Law of Nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>But you say that the Imagination is “illusive.” It is;
it rarely conducts us to truth without first leading us
through error. Its business is to find likenesses and connections
and to suggest explanations, not to point out
differences, and make distinctions, and test explanations;
these latter tasks are to be accomplished not by Imagination
but by Reason with the aid of enlarged experience.
The Imagination suggests to the child that every man is
like his father, every woman like his mother; that the
motion of the sea is like the motion of water in the washing
basin; that the thunder is caused by the rolling of
barrels or discharge of coals up above; that a clock goes
on of itself for ever; and a multitude of other illusions
all arising from the same healthy imaginative conviction
in every young mind that “What has been will be,” and
“The whole world is according to one pattern.” The
conviction is based on a profound general truth, but the
particular shapes which it assumes are often erroneous.
It is only after a course, and sometimes a very long course,
of experience and experiment, that the child, or perhaps
the man, eliminates with the aid of Reason those ideas
which will not work, and confirms those that will work,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>till the latter become at last strong and inherent and
quasi-instinctive convictions. None the less, if the
Imagination did not first suggest the ideas on which the
Reason is to operate, we should never obtain anything
worth calling knowledge.</p>

<p class='c006'>We might express all this by saying that Imagination
is the mother of working-hypotheses; and this is true of
all working-hypotheses, those of the observatory and
laboratory as well as those of the nursery. No one who
grasps this truth will henceforth deny the debt of science
to Imagination. Knowledge is not worth calling knowledge
till it is reduced to Law; and Law, as I have
shown you above, is a mere idea of the Imagination.
I do not deny the subsequent value of Reason; but
Imagination must come first. It was from the Imagination
that there first flashed upon the mind of Newton the
vision of the working-hypothesis by which the apple’s fall
and the planet’s path might be simultaneously explained.
Then came in Reason, with experiment, testing, comparing,
prepared to detect discrepancies, unlikelihoods,
and any want of harmony between the new theory and
the old order of things. Finally, the once-no-more-than-working-hypothesis,
having been found to harmonize
with countless past and present phenomena and having
enabled us to predict countless future phenomena, is now
called a Law, and we are practically certain that it will
act. The approval of this Law we owe to Reason, but
for the suggestion of it we are indebted to Imagination.
On the debt owed to Imagination by Mathematics—the
foundation of all science—I will not add anything to what
has been said in a recent letter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next as to the work of Imagination in art. Poets and
artists, as well as astronomers, must be, so to speak,
<i>ex analogia Universi</i>; that is to say, they must be in
harmony with that order of things which they long to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>reveal to their fellow-men; they must see Law and Unity
where others fail to see it; they must have inherited or
received capacities and intuitions which give them an
intense sympathy with the deep-down-hidden rhythms
and abysmal motions which regulate atoms and sounds
and hues and shapes, and the thoughts and feelings of
men. An artist who wishes to paint a hill-side, or a wave,
or a face, must have a vision of it. He must see it not
only exactly as it is, but how it is: he sympathizes, as it
were, with every cleft and runlet and hollow and projection
of the hill, with every turn and fold and shade and
hue of the ever-varying wave: he realizes the secret of
Nature’s working. Shall we make a distinction between
the secret in the one case and the other? Shall we say
the “spirit” of the face, but the “law” of the hill
and the “law” of the wave? Or will not the intuition
into this complex combination of multitudinous forces,
apparently free and conflicting yet all guided and controlled
into one harmonious result, be better expressed by
saying that he enters into the “spirit” in all cases, the
“spirit” of the hill, the wave, and the face? In proportion
as he has this power, a great artist will be less likely
to speak about it, and less able to explain it: but have it
he must; and it is a power really not dissimilar, though
apparently most different, from the scientific Imagination.
It is, in both cases, a power of recognizing Order and
Unity. The test also of the artistic, is (roughly speaking)
the same as that of the scientific Imagination. Those
ideas are right which “work.” Does a scientific idea
open, like a key, the secrets of Nature? Then it “works,”
and is, so far, right. So in art: to imagine rightly is to
imagine powerfully so as to sway the minds of men.
Those artistic imaginations are wrong which fail to fit
the wards of the complicated human lock and to stir the
inmost thoughts. There are obvious objections to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>definition of what is artistically right; what stirs the
Athenian may not stir the Esquimaux. But, roughly
speaking, we may say that the test has held good. What
has stirred the Athenian has stirred the great civilising
races of the world. There may be a better and a higher
test hereafter; but, for the present at all events, prolonged
experience of its “working” is the test of artistic
Imagination.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the Imagination plays, perhaps, its most important
part in our conceptions of human emotions and human
character. These things cannot be exactly defined, like
triangles or circles; nor can they or their results be predicted
like the results of chemical action or the instinctive
motions of irrational animals. Yet the Imagination
helps us, after a sympathetic contemplation of what a
friend <i>has</i> done and said and wished, to complete the
picture by taking as it were a bird’s-eye view of his past,
present and future, so as to be able in some measure to
realize and predict what he <i>will</i> do and say and wish.
This mental “imagination,” “image,” or “idea” of our
friend we might describe as the “law” of his being, so far
as it was grasped by us: but so much more subtle and
variable than any known “law” are the sequences of
human thought and conduct, that we generally prefer the
phrase which we just now used to describe the intuition
of the artist; and so we speak of “entering into the
spirit” of a man. It is usual to say that we do this by
“sympathy;” but sympathy is only one form of Imagination
tinged with love, the power of imagining the joys
and sorrows of others and of realizing them as one’s own.
Imagination, without love, might realize the sorrows of
an enemy to gloat over them: love, if it could be without
Imagination—which it cannot be, since love implies at
least some imagination of what the beloved would wish—would
be a poor lifeless sentiment doing nothing, or nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>to the purpose. But imaginative love, or sympathy, gives
us the key to the knowledge of all human nature, and is
the foundation of all domestic and social unity and order.</p>

<p class='c006'>As to the test of Imagination when brought to bear
upon human nature, you will remember, I dare say, that
it was determined to be the success with which it “worked”
human nature, or, in other words, made men do “what
they are intended to do.” But I was then speaking of the
way in which the great prophets, lawgivers, and founders
of religions have influenced great masses of mankind,
and in which almost every mother influences her children,
by idealizing them. I might have added, and I will now
add, a word on the manner in which an imaginary ideal of
human nature proves its truth experimentally to the
imaginer, by “working” <i>him</i>, that is, by making <i>him</i>
capable of doing “the work he was intended to do.” It
is the more necessary to do this because the illusions of
Imagination are nowhere so strong and so lasting as in
the study of human Nature; and there is a danger that
we may be deterred by the thought of them from steadily
pursuing the truth. The cynic tells us with a sneer that
babies, and none but babies, think men and women better
than they are, and that, the older one grows, the more one is
disillusionised about the virtue of human nature. But that
is not true, or only a half truth. If we, as children, imagine
the men and women about us to be perfections of power,
wisdom, and virtue, one reason is, that we have, as children,
a most inadequate standard of physical, mental,
and moral excellence. As our standard rises, our sense of
inadequacy increases; but the reason why, as we grow
older, we cease to think people perfect, is, very often, not
that we think worse of human beings, but that we think
better of human possibilities.</p>

<p class='c006'>But in some minds defect of Imagination combines
with other causes to induce the repeatedly disillusionised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>man to give up the search after the truth that lies beneath
the illusion and to cast away all trust, all thought, of any
ideal of humanity. Those who do this make shipwreck
of their own lives. Their low ideal or no-ideal of conduct
does not “work;” that is to say, it does not fit them to
do the work they were intended to do. Even for the purposes
of their own happiness their life is a failure. So
far as the spiritual side of their nature is concerned, a
dull and stagnant self-satisfaction is the highest prize they
can hope to acquire: they have none of the keen joys of
spiritual aspiration, of failures redeemed, of gradual progress,
and of deeper insight into the glorious possibilities
of human nature. But those who, while not rejecting the
sobering admonitions of Experience and Reason, can
nevertheless so far obey the promptings of Imagination
as to retain in their hearts an ever fresh and expansive
and healthful Ideal of life, find themselves led on by it
from hope to nobler hope, from effort to more arduous
effort, until life and effort end together.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let this suffice as my protest against the popular fallacy
that the Imagination is an abnormal faculty, limited to
poets and painters and “artists,” mostly illusive, and
always to be subordinated in the search after truth. I
maintain, on the contrary, that it lies at the basis of all
knowledge; that it is no less necessary for science, for
morals, and for religion, than for artistic success; and
that the illusions of Imagination are the stepping-stones
to Truths.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now to speak of Reason, or, as some would call it,
Understanding. While dealing with Imagination, we recognized
that the work of Reason is mostly negative and
corrective: but let us come to detail. Reason is commonly
said to proceed by two methods; (i) by Induction, wherein,
by “inducing,” or introducing, a number of particular
instances (<i>e.g.</i> “A, B, C, &amp;c., are men and are mortal”),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>you establish a general conclusion (“all men are mortal”);
(ii) by Deduction, wherein, from two previous statements
called Premises, you deduce a third, called a
Conclusion.</p>

<p class='c006'>(i) As regards Induction, surely you must admit that
the initial part of the task falls not upon the Reason but
upon the Imagination; which sees likenesses and leaps to
general conclusions, mostly premature or false, but all containing
a truth from which the falsehood must be eliminated.
Thus, a child imagines, by premature Induction, that all
men are (1) like his father; (2) black haired; (3) between
five and six feet high; (4) white-skinned, and so on. Then
comes Reason afterwards, comparing and contrasting
these imaginative premature conclusions with a wider and
contradictory experience and widening the conclusion
accordingly. Hence it is the part of Reason to suggest
those varied experiments which are a necessary part of
scientific Induction; and this is generally done by pointing
out to us some neglected difference: “You say you had
a Turkish bath three times, and each time caught a cold:
but were the antecedents of these three colds quite alike?
If not, how did they differ? Did you not on the first
occasion sit in a draught at a public meeting? on the
second, forget to put on your great coat? on the third, let
the fire out though it was freezing? Consider therefore,
not the single point of likeness, the Turkish bath, but the
points of <i>unlikeness</i> also, in the antecedents of your three
colds; and try the Turkish bath again, omitting these
antecedents, before you say ‘A Turkish bath always gives
me cold.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>You see then that in Induction the positive and suggestive
part of the work is done by the Imagination; the
negative and eliminative part by Reason.</p>

<p class='c006'>(ii) As regards Deduction, the business of Reason is to
ascertain that the Premises are not only true but also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>connected in such a way that a conclusion can be drawn
from them. But even here Imagination plays a part: for
the conclusion of every syllogism (roughly speaking)
depends upon the following axiom: “If <i>a</i> is included in
<i>b</i>, and <i>b</i> is included in <i>c</i>, then <i>a</i> is included in <i>c</i>; in other
words, if a watch is in a box, and the box is in a room,
then the watch is in the room.” Now this general proposition,
like all general propositions, is arrived at with
the aid of the Imagination, so that we may fairly say that
the Imagination, helps to lay the foundation of the
Syllogism. When therefore you bear in mind that in
every Syllogism the Premises are often the result of an
Induction in which Imagination has played a part, and
that the conclusion always depends upon an axiom of
the Imagination, you must admit that even Deductive
Reasoning by no means excludes the Imagination.</p>

<p class='c006'>(iii) Practically, errors seldom arise, and truth is seldom
discovered, from mere Deductive Reasoning. Any one
can see his way through a logical Syllogism, and almost
any one can lay his finger on the weak point in an illogical
one. But the difficulty is to start the Reasoning in the
right direction and to begin the Logical Chain with an
appropriate Syllogism.</p>

<p class='c006'>For example, suppose we wish to prove that “every
triangle which has two angles equal, has two sides opposite
to them equal”: how can our Reason, our discriminative
faculty, help us here? At present, not at all. We must
first call to our aid the Imagination, which says to us,
“<i>Imagine</i> the triangle with two equal angles to have two
unequal sides opposite to them, and see what follows.”
And every one who has done a geometrical Deduction
knows that we frequently start by “imagining” the conclusion
to be already proved, or the problem to be already
performed, and then endeavouring to realise, among the
many consequences that would follow, which of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>consequences would harmonize with, or be identical with,
the data to which we are working back.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same process is common in the reasoning that deals
with what is called Circumstantial Evidence. Thus, it is
asserted by A that he saw B commit a murder in the
midst of a field, five minutes before midnight, on the first
day of last month: how can we test the truth of A’s
assertion? The negative faculty of Reason cannot answer
the question. But once more Imagination steps in and
says, “<i>Imagine</i> the story to be true; <i>imagine</i> yourself to
be in A’s place; <i>imagine</i> the circumstances which would
have surrounded him, the hidden place from which he saw
the murder, the light which enabled him to see it, the
precise sight that he saw, the voices or sounds that
he heard, and, in a word, all the details of a <i>likely</i> and
coherent narrative.” When the Imagination has done this
and “imagined” the place—perhaps a hedge—the light—moonlight,
and so on, Reason steps in, and corroborates
or rejects, by shewing that there was, or was not, a hedge
whence the deed could have been witnessed; that there
was a full moon or no moon on the night in question;
that, if there had been a moon, the place in question was
open to the moonlight, or in deep shadow: and thus
Imagination and Reason (aided by experience of the place
and knowledge of the time) arrive at a conclusion, the
former making a positive, the latter a negative contribution.
Hence it appears that even in those questions
which are called pre-eminently “practical”—for what
can be more “practical” than a trial in a law-court
for life or death?—the Imagination plays so great a
part that without its aid the reason could effect little
or nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here I must break off; but I hope I have said enough
to satisfy you that the imaginative faculty, though it needs
the constant test of Reason and Experience, is far more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>intimately connected with what we call knowledge, than
is commonly supposed. But if this be so, we ought
not (I think) to be surprised if a careful analysis of
our profoundest religious convictions should reveal that
for these also we are indebted, and intended by God to
be indebted, to the Imagination far more than to the
Reason.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h2 id='let07' class='c004'>VII <br /> THE CULTURE OF FAITH</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>I have been very much pained by your sprightly
account of the lively and witty conversation between you
and your clever young friends, —— and ——, on the proofs
of the existence of a God. Bear with me if I assure you
that discussions in that spirit are likely to be fatal to real
faith. They may often be far more dangerous than a
serious collision between untrained faith and the most
highly educated scepticism. I do not deprecate discussion,
but I do most earnestly plead for reverence.</p>

<p class='c006'>Young men at the Universities stand in especial need
of this warning because their studies lead them to be
critical; and habits of criticism may easily weaken the
habit of reverence. I remember once being shewn over
a great public school by the Headmaster, justly celebrated
as a Headmaster once, and much more celebrated since
in another capacity. It was a grand school, though a
little too ecclesiastical to suit my taste. While we were
in the chapel my friend spoke earnestly of the pleasure it
gave him on Sundays to see in the chapel the familiar
faces of the old boys who came to revisit the old place. At
the same time he deplored the contrast between those
who went into the army, and those who went to the Universities:
“The army fellows,” he said, “almost always
come to Communion, the university fellows almost always
stop away.” These words made an indelible impression
on my mind, “Who is to blame, or praise, for this?” asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>I, on my journey homeward. “Is it the army that is to be
praised for its inculcation of discipline and self-subordination,
helping the young fellows to realise the
meaning of self-sacrifice? Or is it the University that
is to be blamed for its negative and destructive teaching?
Or can it be that the school is in part to blame for
teaching the boys to believe too much; and the University
in part to blame for teaching the young men to
criticize too much?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Over and over again, since that time, I have asked
myself these same questions about many other young
men from many other public schools. I honour the army
as much as most men, more perhaps than many do: but
after all the profession of a soldier is the profession of a
throat-cutter; throat-cutting in an extensive, expeditious,
and honourable way,—throat-cutting in one direction often
undertaken merely to prevent throat-cutting in another
direction—but still throat-cutting after all: and it seemed
very hard to believe that the profession of throat-cutting
is, and ought to be, a better preparation than the pursuit
of learning at the Universities, for participation in the Holy
Communion. On the whole I was led to the conclusion
that the young men in the army had retained and
deepened the instinctive obedience to authority, the sense
of the need of the subordination of the individual to the
community, and perhaps also the feeling of reverence,
while they had not been taught so fully to appreciate all
that was implied in attendance at Communion or to realize
the intellectual difficulties presented by the New Testament.
In other words—to put it briefly and roughly—the
young cadets and officers came to Communion because
they had been taught to feel and not taught to think; and
the University men stayed away because they had been
taught to think and not to feel. Now I will ask you to
excuse me if I suggest that the principal danger to your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>character at present arises from the want of such discipline
as may be obtained by some in the army, and by
others in the practical work of life. You need some
emotional and moral exercise to counterbalance your
mental and intellectual training. You are not aware how
much of the most valuable knowledge, conviction, certainty—call
it what you will, but I mean that kind of moral
and spiritual knowledge which is the basis of all right
conduct—springs in the main from spiritual and emotional
sources.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the present letter I should like to confine myself to
this subject, the culture, if I may so say, of Christian faith.
Let me then ask you first to clear your mind by asking
yourself what is the essence of the faith which you would
desire to retain. It is (is it not?) a faith or trust in the
fatherhood of God. This surely is the Gospel or Good
News for which Christ lived and died, in order that He
might breathe it into the hearts of men. “Fatherhood”—some
of your young friends will exclaim—“What an
antiquated notion! Flat anthropomorphism!” By “anthropomorphism”
they mean a tendency to make God in
human shape; just as Heine’s four-legged poetic Bruin
makes God to be a great white Polar Bear, and the frogs
of Celsus imagine Him to be a gigantic Frog. No doubt,
this is very funny; but the decryers of anthropomorphism
who venture on any conception of a God—are
they any less funny? Do not they shew a similar
disposition to make God in the shape of human works
or human experiences? Shall I be exploring a nobler
path of spiritual speculation if I say God is a Rock
or a Buckler, or a Centre, or a Force, than if I say
God is a Father in heaven? Ask your sceptical companions
what conception of God they can mention
which is not open to objection, and they will perhaps
reply “An Eternal, or a Tendency, not ourselves, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>makes for righteousness.” Now to reply “an Eternal,”
appears to me to be taking a rather mean and pedantical
advantage of the uninflected peculiarities of English (and
Hebrew), which leave it an open question whether you
mean your “Eternal” to be masculine, or neuter. And
“Tendency”—what is it? Is it not a “stretching,” or
“pulling,” or partially neutralised force—a common
human experience? Now we are dealing with the accusation
of limiting our conception of God to our experiences
as men. And, so far as this charge is concerned, what
is the difference between calling God a “Tendency,” or
a “Rock,” or a “Shield,” or a “House of Defence,” as
the old Psalmist does? Are not all these names mere
metaphors derived from human experience? In the same
way to call God a Father is (no doubt) a metaphor: but
is it more a metaphor than to call Him a Tendency?</p>

<p class='c006'>Some metaphors, which describe God by reference to
the relations of man to man, may be called anthropomorphic;
others, which describe Him by reference to
implements (such as a Shield) may be called organomorphic;
others, which assimilate Him to lifeless and
inorganic objects (such as a Hill) may be called by some
other grand name, such as apsychomorphic; others,
which would subtilize Him down to a thought, or a mind,
or a spirit, may be called phronesimorphic, noumorphic,
pneumatomorphic; but in the name of common sense—or
in the name of that sense which ought to be common,
and which ought to revolt against bondage to mere words—what
is there in that termination “morphic” which
should stagger a seeker after divine truth? Do we not all
recognize that all terms applied to the supreme God are
“morphisms” of various kinds? And the question is not
how we can avoid a “morphism”—for we cannot avoid
it—but how or where we can find the noblest and most
spiritually helpful “morphism.” And as between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>ancient and the modern metaphors just set before you can
you entertain a moment’s doubt? Might we not imagine
the question put—after the old Roman authoritative
fashion—to an assembly of the consciences of universal
mankind: “Christ says that God is a Father in heaven;
refined thinkers say that He is a Tendency; <i>utri creditis,
gentes</i>?” To which I seem to hear the answer of the
Universe come back, “We will have no Tendencies seated
on the throne of Heaven. Give us a Father, or we will
have nothing.” And you, my dear friend, how is it with
you? <i>Utri credis</i>?</p>

<p class='c006'>But perhaps you complain, or some of your friends
might complain, that this is not treating the question fairly.
“The doctrine of the Fatherhood of God,” they may say,
“is to be discussed like any other proposition, upon the
evidence.” I entirely deny it, if from your “evidence”
you intend to exclude the witness of Imagination expressed
in Faith and Hope. I assert, on the contrary, that it is
to be believed in, against what may be called quasi-evidence.
It cannot be demonstrated to be either true or
false. Do not misunderstand me. There is abundant
evidence of a certain kind—as I will hereafter shew—for
the Fatherhood of God; but there is also evidence against
it: and what I mean is, that the mind is not to sit impartially
and coldly neutral between the two testimonies,
but is to grasp the former and hold it fast and keep it
constantly in view, while it lays less stress on and (after a
time) puts on one side the latter. I have shewn you that
many of our deepest and most vital convictions are based
less upon Reason than upon Imagination. Why then should
we be surprised if the most profound convictions of all,
our religious certainties, rest upon that imaginative
desire to which we have given the name of Faith?<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a>  If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>an archangel (robed in light) were to step down to me
this moment and were to cry aloud, “Verily there is no
God,” I should reply, or ought to reply, “Verily thou art
a devil.” If the same archangel were to come in the same
way and to say “Verily there is a God,” I should reply,
“I felt sure there was; and now I am more sure than
ever.” How unfair, how illogical, if our belief is to
be a matter of mere evidence! But it is not to be a
matter of mere evidence. It is to be a struggle against
an evil thought—shall I not say an evil being?—that is
perpetually attempting to slander God to men by representing
Him as permitting or originating evil.</p>

<p class='c006'>Does this startle you—this suggestion of an evil being—as
being too old-fashioned for an educated Christian?
Well then, put it aside for the time (though it is indeed
Christ’s doctrine): and merely assume as a temporary
hypothesis that the essence of Christ’s Gospel is a trust in
the Fatherhood of God. Now, if this be so, and if this
trust or faith is to be kept pure and strong, must it not be
regarded with reverence and reserve as being (what indeed
it is) a kind of private, domestic, and family relation? Is
it to be made the subject for light, casual, frivolous discussions;
epigrammatic displays; cut-and-thrust exhibitions
of word-fence; logical or rhetorical symposia?
What would you say of a young man who should allow his
relations with his father and mother to be discussed with
humour and epigram on every light occasion? Would
he be likely long to retain the bloom of domestic affection
unimpaired? I remember reading about some well-educated
and enlightened free-thinker—I fancy it was
Bolingbroke—on whose table a Greek Testament was
regularly placed by the side of the port when the cloth was
drawn, and whose favourite topic for discussion after
dinner was the existence and attributes of the Deity.
Does not your instinct teach you that from such discussions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>as these no good could possibly come, nothing but
a hardening of the conscience, a fatal familiarity with
sacred things regarded with a view to witticism—that kind
of familiarity which too surely breeds contempt? What
a terrible contrast it is—complacent Bolingbroke at his
wine, analysing the attributes of God, and the all-pitying
Father looking down from heaven and pleading, through
Christ, not to be analysed but to be loved and trusted!</p>

<p class='c006'>May we not go a step further and say that Christian
Faith or trust—if it be once recognized as faith or
trust, altogether distinct from the kind of assent which
we give to a proposition of Euclid—needs not only to
be protected from certain evil influences but also to be
subjected to certain good influences? It is a kind of
plant, and requires its spiritual soil, air, rain and sunshine;
in other words it needs good thoughts, noble aspirations,
and unselfish acts, to keep it alive. You may retort perhaps
that Faith itself ought to produce these results, and
not to be produced by them. But I reply that, though
Faith does tend to produce these results, it is strengthened
by producing them; and it is weakened and finally extinguished
by not producing them. “Our faith” has been
described as “the victory that hath overcome the world.”
What is there in the world that it should need to be
“overcome”? I suppose the writer meant that this
present, visible, tangible, enjoyable system of things—which
was meant by the Supreme to be a kind of glass
through which we might discern something of the
greatness and order of the Maker has been converted,
partly by our selfishness, partly by some Evil in the world
outside us, into a mirror shutting out all glimpse of God
and giving us back nothing but the reflection of ourselves.
On the other hand, there is a different way of regarding
the world when, our eyes being opened like the eyes of
Aeneas amid burning Troy, we discern in the midst of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>this present condition of things a great conflict between
Good and Evil, and on the side of goodness, we see the
forms of Righteousness, Justice and Truth, supported by
Faith, Hope, and Charity; amid the smoke and roar of
battles and revolutions, the destructions of nations, and the
downfall of empires and of churches, we realise that these
are abiding influences; that either in this world, or in
some other, these things shall ultimately prevail, because
these are the Angels that stand about the throne of the
Ruler of the Universe. This state of mind is Faith, and
it is to be nurtured by effort, partly in action, partly in
thought. Bacon bids us nurture it by “cherishing the
good hours of the mind.” St. Paul says nearly the same
thing in different words: “Whatsoever things are honourable,
whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are
pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are
of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any
praise, <i>think on these things</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Are you surprised at this? Does faith seem to you, on
these terms, a possession of little worth—this quicksilver
quality which varies with every variation of our spiritual
atmosphere? Why surely everything that lives and grows
is liable to flux. You do not disparage bodily health
because it is dependent on supports and influences, and
liable to changes; why then disparage spiritual health
because it is similarly dependent? No doubt one would
not be willingly a religious valetudinarian; a man’s
spiritual constitution ought not to be at the mercy of every
slight and passing breeze of circumstance; but at present
there is little danger of spiritual valetudinarianism.
Physical “sanitation” is on every one’s tongue; but no
one thinks of the necessity of good spiritual air and of the
evils of bad spiritual drainage. We do not recognize that
there are laws of our spiritual as well as of our material
nature. We wilfully narrow our lives to the sabbathless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>pursuit of gain or pleasure—self everywhere, God nowhere—and
then go about hypocritically whining that the age
of faith has passed and that we have lost the power of
believing. With our own hands we put the stopper on the
telescope and then complain that we cannot see!</p>

<p class='c006'>Do not however, suppose that I call upon you, because
hope is the basis of Christian belief, on that account to
hope against the truth and to believe against reason. I
bid you believe in the Fatherhood of God, first because
your conscience tells you that this is the best and noblest
belief, but secondly also because this belief—although it
may be against the superficial evidence of the phenomena
of the Universe—is in accordance with these phenomena
when you regard them more deeply and when you include
in your scope the history of Christianity.</p>

<p class='c006'>I admit that we have to fight against temptations in
order to retain this belief; and sometimes I ask myself,
“If I and my children had been slaves in one of the
Southern States of America; or if I and my family had
suffered such indelible outrages as were recently inflicted
by the Turks upon the Bulgarians; or if I were at this
moment a matchbox-seller or a father of ten children (girls
as well as boys) in the East of London—should I find it
so easy to believe that God is our Father in heaven?”
And I am obliged to reply, “No, I should not find it easy;”
I fear that I might be tempted to say, as a workman did
not long ago to a lecturer on co-operation who mentioned
the name of God: “Oh, no; no God for us; the workman’s
God deserted him long ago.” And perhaps you
yourself may remember the answer of one of those
wretched Bulgarians to some newspaper correspondent
who endeavoured to console him in his anguish by the reflection
that “After all there is a God that governs the
world:” “I believe you,” was the reply; “there is indeed
a God; and he governs the world indeed; and he is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Devil.” Or take a spectacle of the Middle Ages as a
problem. In the lists are two armed knights; on the
one side a man of might and muscle, exulting in conflict;
on the other, a slight, weak creature, who never fights
save on compulsion, and is to fight now on sternest compulsion,
being accused (though innocent) of some gross
crime by yonder man of flesh, who combines scoundrel,
liar, traitor, oppressor, thief, and adulterer, all in one; and
the fight is to begin under the sanction of the Church of
Christ. As the trumpets sound, while the heralds are still
calling on God to “shew the right,” the two men meet,
and “the right” is cast to the ground, trampled on by his
enemy, and dragged from the lists to the neighbouring
gallows, while the muscular scoundrel wipes his forehead
and receives congratulations. Do you suppose that the
innocent man’s wife, if she were looking on, would be able
easily to say at that moment, “Verily there is a God that
judgeth the earth”?</p>

<p class='c006'>Can I possibly put the case for scepticism more strongly?
I would fain put it with all the force in my power in order
to convince you that I have thought often over these
matters, and that, although my own life may have been
happy and free from stumbling-blocks, I have at least
tried to understand and sympathize with those who find
it very hard to believe that there is a God. But, in the
presence of such monstrous evils as these, I take refuge in a
belief and in a fact; first, in the belief (which runs through
almost every page of the Gospels and has received the
sanction of Christ Himself) that there is an Evil Being in
the world who is continually opposing the Good but will
be ultimately subdued by the Good; secondly, in the
fact that in one great typical conflict between Good and
Evil,—where apparently God did not “shew the right,”
and where, in appearance, there was consummated the
most brutal triumph of Evil over Good that the world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>ever witnessed—there the Good in reality effected its most
signal triumph. The issue of the conflict on the Cross
of Christ is my great comfort and mainstay of faith, when
my heart is distracted with the thought of all the spurns,
buffets, and outrages, endured by much-suffering humanity.
“At last, far off,” I cry, “the right will be shewn, even as
it was in the contest on the Cross.”</p>

<p class='c006'>You see then the nature of the conflict of faith. It is
a struggle of hope against fear, trustfulness against
trustlessness, where strict logical proof is impossible.
But I do not call you to set Faith against Reason, or to
make hope trample on the understanding, or to shut your
eyes to the presence or absence of historical evidence.
If religion comes down from the region of hope and
aspiration into the region of fact and evidence, and
asserts that this or that fact happened at this or that time
and place, then, so far, it appeals to evidence, and by
evidence it must be judged.</p>

<p class='c006'>Half the earnest scepticism of the present day is not
really spiritual scepticism but simply doubt about historical
facts. Distinguish carefully and constantly between
two terms entirely different but continually confused—the
<i>super-natural</i> and the <i>miraculous</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the super-natural every rational man must believe,
if he knows what is meant by the term; for every
rational man must acknowledge that the world had either
a beginning or no beginning, a First Cause or no First
Cause; and either hypothesis is altogether above the
level of natural phenomena, and therefore supernatural.
The theist and the atheist are alike believers in the
supernatural. The agnostic, poised between the two,
admits that some supernatural origin of the world is
necessary, but is unable to decide which of the two is the
more probable. All alike therefore believe in the supernatural;
but the important difference is that some take a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>hopeful or faithful, others a hopeless or faithless, view of
the supernatural. Proof in this region is not possible,
unless the testimony of the conscience may be accepted
as proof. If Jesus were to appear to-morrow sitting on
the clouds of heaven and testifying that there is a Father
in heaven, I can imagine some men of science replying,
“This is a mere phantom of the brain,” or, “This is the
result of indigestion,” or “Assertion is not proof.”
Mere force of logical proof or personal observation can
convince no one that there is a God or that Jesus is the
Eternal Son of God; such a conviction can only come from
a leaping out of the human spirit to meet the Spirit of
God; and hence St. Paul tells us that “no man can say”—that
is, “say sincerely”—“that Jesus is the Lord <i>save by
the Spirit</i>.” Here therefore, in this region of the indemonstrable,
I can honestly use an effort of the will to
ally myself with the spirit of faith. “I will pray to God; I
will cling to God; will refuse to doubt of God; refuse to
listen to doubts about God (except so far as may be
needful to do it, in order to lighten the doubts of others,
and then only as a painful duty, to be got through with all
speed); I am determined (so help me God) to believe in
God to the end of my days:” resolving thus I am not
acting insincerely nor shutting my eyes to the truth, but
taking nature’s appointed means for reaching and holding
fast the highest spiritual truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>But I do not feel justified in thus using my will to
constrain myself to believe in the miraculous; for here
God has given me other means—such as history, experience,
and evidence—for arriving at the truth. Nor does
a belief in the super-natural in the least imply a belief in
the miraculous also. I may believe that God is continually
supporting and impelling on its path every
created thing; but I may also believe that there is no
evidence to prove that His support and impulsion have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>ever been manifested save in accordance with that
orderly sequence which we call Law. I may even believe
that the Universe is double, having a spiritual and
invisible counterpart corresponding to this visible and
material existence, so that nothing is done in the world
of flesh below which has not been first done in the
world of spirit above; yet even this latitude of spiritual
speculation would not in the least establish the conclusion
that the observed sequence of what we call
cause and effect in the material world has ever been
violated. To take a particular instance, I may be convinced,
that Jesus of Nazareth was the Eternal Word of
God, made flesh for men; and yet I may remain unconvinced
that, in thus taking flesh upon Him, He raised
Himself above the physical laws of humanity. In other
words I may, with the author of the Fourth Gospel,
heartily believe in the supernatural Incarnation while
omitting from my Gospel all mention of the Miraculous
Conception. Nay, I may go still further. While cordially
accepting the divine nature of Christ, I may see
such clear indications and evidences of the manner in
which accounts of miracles sprang up in the Church
without foundation of fact, that I may be compelled not
merely to omit miracles from my Gospel and to confess
myself unconvinced of their truth, but even to avow my
conviction of their untruth. But into this negative aspect
of things I do not wish now to enter. I would rather urge
on you this positive consideration, that, since our recognition
of the Laws of Nature themselves, depends in a very
large degree upon faith, we ought not to be surprised if our
acknowledgment of the Founder of these Laws rests also on
the same basis. And, if this be so, we cannot speak accurately
about the “evidence” for the existence of a God,
unless we include in that term the aspirations of the human
conscience toward a Maker and Ruler and Father of all.</p>

  <h2 id='let08' class='c004'>VIII <br /> FAITH AND DEMONSTRATION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>I am afraid your notions about “proof” are still
rather hazy; for you quote against me a stern and self-denying
dictum which passes current among some of
your young friends, that “it is immoral to believe what
cannot be proved.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Have you seriously asked yourself what you mean by
“proved” in enunciating this proposition? Do you mean
“made sufficiently probable to induce a man to act upon
the probability”? Or do you mean “absolutely demonstrated”?</p>

<p class='c006'>If you mean the former, not so many as you suppose
are guilty of this “immorality.” Give me an instance,
if you can, of a man who “believes what cannot be made
sufficiently probable to induce him to act upon the probability.”
Of course some men <i>say</i> they believe what
they, in reality, do not believe; but you speak, not about
“saying” but about “believing;” and I do not see how any
man can “believe” what he does not regard as probable.
I am inclined to think therefore that, in this sense of the
word “prove,” your proposition is meaningless.</p>

<p class='c006'>But perhaps by “prove,” you mean “absolutely demonstrate;”
and your thesis is that “it is immoral to believe
what cannot be absolutely demonstrated;” in that case I
am obliged to ask you how you can repeat such cant, such
a mere parrot cry, with a grave face.</p>

<p class='c006'>Do you not see that, as soon as you conceded (as I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>understand you to have done) that our belief in the Laws
of Nature is based upon the Imagination, you virtually
conceded the validity of a kind of proof in which faith
and hope play a large part, and in which demonstration
is impossible. “Demonstration” applies to mathematics
and to syllogisms where the premises are granted, though
it is also sometimes loosely used of proof conveyed by
personal observation; “proof” applies to the other affairs
of life. Demonstration appeals very largely (not entirely,
as I have shown above, but very largely) to Reason;
proof is largely based on Faith. Having defined “angles,”
“triangles,” “base,” and “isosceles,” and having been
granted certain axioms and postulates, I can demonstrate
that the angles at the basis of an isosceles triangle are
equal to one another; but I cannot “demonstrate” that,
if I throw a stone in the air, it will come down again,
though I am perfectly convinced that it will come down,
and though I commonly assert that I can “prove” that it
will come down.</p>

<p class='c006'>Why, your whole life is full of beliefs—as certain as any
beliefs can be—which it is impossible to demonstrate!
When you got up this morning did you not believe that
your razor would shave and your looking-glass reflect;
that your boiling water would scald if you spilt it, and
your egg break if you dropped it; and a score or two of
other similar perfectly certain beliefs—all entertained and
acted on in less than an hour, but all incapable of demonstration?
But you maintain perhaps that “these beliefs are
not beliefs, but knowledge based on the uniformity of the
laws of nature; you know that the laws of nature are
uniform, and therefore you knew that your razor would
shave.” But how, I ask, do you know that the laws of
nature are uniform? “By the experience of mankind
during many thousands of years.” But how do you know
that what has been in the past will be in the future—will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>be in the next instant?  “Well, if a law of nature were
broken—say, for example, the law of gravitation—the whole
Universe would fall to pieces.” In other words, you and
I would feel extremely uncomfortable, if we existed long
enough to feel anything; but what does that demonstrate?
Absolutely nothing. It would no doubt be extremely
inconvenient for both of us if any law of nature observed
in the past did not continue to be observed in the future;
but inconvenience proves nothing logically. It is no doubt
extremely inconvenient not to be able to believe that your
razor will shave; but what of that? Where is the demonstration?
And remember your own <i>dictum</i>, “It is immoral
to believe what cannot be demonstrated.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps you may try to writhe out of this application of
your own principle by the use of grand terms; “The Laws
of Nature have been proved to be true by experiment as
well as by observation; they have been made the basis
for abstruse calculations and inferences as to what will
happen; then the philosopher has predicted ‘this will
happen,’ and it has happened. Surely no one will deny
that this is a proof!” A proof of what? Of the future
invariableness of the sequences of Nature? I shall not
only deny, but enjoy denying, that it is a proof; if you
mean by proof such a demonstrative proof as you obtain
in a syllogism, where the premises are assumed, or in
mathematics, where you are reasoning about things that
have no real existence but are merely convenient ideas
of the imagination. Believe me, this distinction of
terms is by no means superfluous. You and your young
scientific friends are continually confusing “proof” with
“demonstration;” and you have one use of the word
“proof” for religion and another for science. When you
speak of religion, you say “it is immoral to believe in it
for it cannot be <i>proved</i>” (meaning “demonstrated”);
when you speak of science, you say, “This can be <i>proved</i>”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>(not meaning “demonstrated,” but simply “made probable,”
or “proved for practical purposes”).</p>

<p class='c006'>You may discourse for hours upon the Laws of Nature,
but you will never succeed in convincing any one, not even
yourself, that they will remain valid in the moment that is
to come, by the mere force of logic. You are certain—so
am I practically quite certain—that the stone which I
throw at this moment up in the air, will, in the next
moment, fall to the ground. But this certainty does not
arise from logic. We have absolutely no reason for this
leap into the darkness of the future except faith,—faith of
course resting upon a basis of facts, but still faith. The
very names and notions of “cause” and “effect” are due
not to observation, nor to demonstration, but to faith. The
name, and the notion, of a Law of Nature are nothing but
convenient ideas of the scientific imagination, based upon
faith. Take an instance. We say, and genuinely believe,
that fire and gunpowder “cause” explosion; that explosion
is the “effect” of gunpowder and fire; and that the effect
follows the causes in accordance with the “laws of
nature;” but you have not observed all this and you
cannot demonstrate it. You have merely observed in the
past an invariable sequence of explosion following (in all
cases that you have seen or heard about) the combination
of gunpowder and fire; you have also perhaps predicted
in the past that explosion would follow, and demonstrated
that it did follow this combination, as often as you pleased;
you have found, or have heard that others have found,
that this sequence agrees with other chemical sequences,
which you are in the habit of calling causes and effects;
but all this is evidence as to the past, not as to the future.
Your certainty as to the future arises not from any demonstration
about the future, but from your faith or trust
in the fixed order of Nature, and from nothing else. Now
the greater part of the action of life deals with the future.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>It follows therefore that, in the greater part of life, we act,
not from demonstration, but from a proof in which faith
is a constituent element.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whence arises this trust in the uniformity of the phenomena
of the Universe? We can hardly give any other
answer except that we could not get on without it. Having
been found to “work” by ourselves, and by many generations
of our forefathers, this faith is possibly by this time
an inherited instinct as well as the inbred result of our
own earliest experiences. But when we analyse it we are
forced to confess that we can give no logical account of
it. Logically regarded, it savours of the most audacious
optimism, arguing, or rather sentimentalizing, after this
fashion: “It would be so immensely inconvenient if
Nature were every moment changing her rules without
notice! All forethought, all civilization would be at an
end; nay, we could not so much as take a single step
or move a limb with confidence, if we could not depend
upon Nature!” Does not this personification of Nature,
and trust or faith in Nature, somewhat resemble our trust
or faith in God? I think it does; and it is very interesting
to note that the very foundations of science are
laid in a quasi-religious sentiment of which no logical
justification can be given.</p>

<p class='c006'>I might easily go further and shew that, even as regards
the past, we act in our daily lives very often on the grounds
of faith and very seldom on the grounds of demonstration.
On this I have touched in a previous letter; but your
dictum about the “immorality of believing what cannot be
proved” makes it clear that you are hardly as yet aware of
the nature of the ordinary “proofs” on which we act.
How few there are who have any grounds but faith for believing
in the existence of a Julius Cæsar or an Alexander!
Yet they believe implicitly. Many have heard these two
great men loosely spoken of, or alluded to; but they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>never weighed, nor have they the least power to weigh, the
evidence that proves that Cæsar and Alexander actually
existed. Now as the unlearned are quite certain of the
existence of a Julius Cæsar, so are you too quite certain
of many facts upon very slight grounds. You ask one
man his name; another, how many children he has; a
third, the name of the street in which he lives, and so
on; how certain you often feel, on the slight evidence of
their answers (unless there be special grounds for suspecting
them) that your information is correct! The
reason is that all social intercourse depends on faith; if
you began to suspect and disbelieve every man who gave
you answers to such simple questions as these, social life
would be at an end for you, and you might as well at once
retire to a hermitage; scepticism in matters of this kind
has not worked, and faith has worked; and this has gone
on with you from childhood and with your forefathers
from their childhood for many generations. Thus faith has
become a second instinct with you, and you act upon it so
often and so naturally that you are not aware of the degree
to which it influences and permeates your actions. The
cases in which you act thus instinctively upon very slight
evidence, and upon a large and general faith in the people
who give the evidence, are far more numerous than those
cases in which you formally weigh evidence and attempt
to arrive at something like demonstrative proof. In other
words, not only as regards the future but also as regards
the past, faith is for the most part the underlying basis of
action. You believe, to a large extent and in a great
many cases, simply because “it would be so immensely
inconvenient not to believe.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I claim that I have fulfilled my promise of shewing
that people act much more upon faith than upon demonstration
in every department of life; and I now repeat
and emphasize what I said before, that if all our existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>is thus dominated by faith, it is absurd to attempt to exclude
faith from any religion. But if our special religion
consists in a recognition of God the Maker as God the
Father, then it is more natural than ever to suppose that our
religion will require a large element of faith or trust. Just
as family life would break down if the sons were always
analysing the father’s character, and declining to believe
anything to his credit beyond what could be demonstrated
to be true, so religious life will break down, if we treat the
Father in heaven as a mere topic for logical discussion
and declare that it is “immoral to believe” in His fatherhood
if it cannot be proved.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of course I do not deny that you must have evidence of
the existence of the Father before you can trust in Him.
You could not trust your parents if you had not seen,
touched, heard them—known something of them in fact
through the senses: so neither can you trust God if you
have not known something of Him through the senses.
Well, I maintain that is what you are continually doing.
God is continually revealing Himself to us in the power,
the beauty, the glory, the harmony, the beneficence, the
mystery, of the Universe, and pre-eminently in human
goodness and greatness. Contemplate, touch, hear; concentrate
your mind on these things, and especially on the
perfection of human goodness, power, and wisdom: thus
you will be enabled to realize the presence of the Father
and then to trust in Him. Contemplate also the Evolution
of the present from the past: the ascent from a protoplasm
to the first man, from the first man to a Homer,
a Dante, a Shakespeare and a Newton; do not entirely
ignore Socrates, St. Paul, St. Francis. You cannot indeed
shut your eyes to the growth of evil simultaneously with
the growth of good: but do not fix your eyes too long
upon the evil: prefer to contemplate the defeat of evil by
goodness, especially in the struggle on the Cross; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>with your contemplation let there be some admixture of
action against the evil and for the good. Do this, and I
think you will have no reason to complain of the want of
“evidence” of the existence of One who has made us to
trust in Him.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have told you what to do: let me add one word also
of warning as to what you are not to do. You are not to
regard the world from the point of view of a neutral
and amused spectator. You are not to detach yourself
from the great struggle of good against evil, and to look
on, and call it “interesting.” That attitude is fatal to
all religion. Reject, as from the devil, the precept <i>nil
admirari</i>; better be a fool than a dispassionate critic
of Christ. Again, you are not to regard the world from
the mere student point of view, looking at the Universe
as a great Examination Paper in which you may hope to
solve more problems and score more marks than anybody
else. High intellectual pursuits and habits of enthusiastic
research are sometimes terribly demoralizing
when they tempt a man to think that he can live above,
and without, social ties and affections, and that mere sentiment
is to be despised in comparison with knowledge.
This danger impends over literary as well as other
students, over critical theologians as well as over scientific
experimenters; we all sometimes forget—we students—that,
if we do not exercise the habit of trusting and
loving men, we cannot trust and love God. To harden
oneself against the mute but trustful appeal of even a
beast is not without some spiritual peril of incapacitating
oneself for worship.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>
  <h2 id='let09' class='c004'>IX <br /> SATAN AND EVOLUTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>Your grounds of objection appear to be now changed.
You say you do not understand my position with regard
to Evolution, as I described it before, and referred to
it in my last letter. If I admit Evolution, you ask how
I can consistently deny that every nation and every
individual, Israel and Christ included, “proceeded from
material causes by necessary sequence according to fixed
laws;” and in that case what becomes of such metaphors
as “the regulating hand of God,” “God the Ruler of
the Universe” and the like? It is a common saying,
you tell me, among those of your companions who have
a turn for science, that “Evolution has disposed of the old
proofs of the existence of a God:” and you ask me how I
meet this objection.</p>

<p class='c006'>I meet it by asking you another question exactly like
your own. I take a lump of clay and a potter’s wheel,
and “from these material causes by necessary sequence
according to fixed laws” I mould a vessel; is there no
room in this process for “the regulating hand of man”
and for “man the creator of the vessel”? In other words,
may not these “fixed laws,” and that “necessity” of
which you admit the existence, represent the perpetual
pressure of the Creator’s hand, or will, upon the Universe?</p>

<p class='c006'>By Evolution is meant that all results are evolved from
immediate causes, which are evolved from distant causes,
which are themselves evolved from more distant causes;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>and so on. In old times, men believed that God made
the world by a number of isolated acts. Now, it is believed
that He made a primordial something, say atoms,
out of which there have been shaped series upon series of
results by continuous motion in accordance with fixed
laws of nature. But neither the isolated theory nor the
continuous theory can dispense with a Creator in the
centre. We speak of the “chain of creation;” and we
know that in old days men recognized few links between
us and the Creator. Now, we recognize many. But,
because a chain has more links than we once supposed,
are we excused for rejecting our old belief in the existence
of a chain-maker? Whether things came to be as they
are, by many creations, or by one creation and many
evolutions, what difference does it make? In the one
case, we believe in a Creator and Sustainer: in the other
case, in a Creator and Evolver. In either case, do we not
believe in a God?</p>

<p class='c006'>What then do your young friends mean—for though
they express themselves loosely, I think they do mean
something and are not merely repeating a cant phrase—when
they say that Evolution has “disposed of the old
proofs of the existence of a God”? I think they mean
that Evolution is inconsistent with the existence of <i>such a
God as the Christian religion proclaims, that is to say,
a Father in heaven</i>. The old theory of discontinuous
creation (in its most exaggerated form) maintained that
everything was created for a certain benevolent purpose—our
hair to shelter our heads from the weather, our eyebrows
and eyelashes to keep off the dust and the sun, our
thumbs to give us that prehensile power which largely
differentiates us from apes; in a word, paternal despotism
was supposed to do everything for us with the best of intentions.
The new theory says there is no sufficient
evidence of such paternal benevolence. Our hair and our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>eyebrows and eyelashes and thumbs came to us in quite
a different fashion. Life, ever since life existed, has been
one vast scramble and conflict for the good things of this
world: those beings that were best fitted for scrambling
and fighting destroyed those that were unfit, and thus
propagated the peculiarities of the conquerors and destroyed
the peculiarities of the conquered. Thus the
characteristics of body or brain best fitted for the purpose
of life were developed, and the unfit were destroyed.
Although therefore a purpose was achieved, it was not
achieved as a purpose, but as a consequence. There is
no room, say the supporters of Evolution, in such a theory
as this for the hypothesis of an Almighty Father of mankind,
or even of a very intelligent Maker. What should we
think of a British workman who, in order to make one
good brick, made a hundred bad ones, or of a cattle-breeder
whose plan was to breed a thousand inferior beasts
on inadequate pasture, in order ultimately to produce, out
of their struggles for food, and as a result of the elimination
of the unfittest, one pre-eminent pair?</p>

<p class='c006'>When he expresses himself in this way, my sympathies
go very far with the man of science, if only he could remember
that he is protesting, not against Christ’s teaching
about God, but against some other quite different theory.
Though God is called “Almighty” in the New Testament,
we must remember that it is always assumed that there is
an opposing Evil, an Adversary or Satan, who will ultimately
be subdued but is meantime working against the
will of God. The origin of this Evil the followers of
Christ do not profess to understand but we believe that
it was not originated by God and that it is not obedient
to Him. We cannot therefore, strictly speaking, say that
God is the Almighty ruler of “the Universe <i>as it is</i>.” God
is King <i>de jure</i>, but not at present <i>de facto</i> (metaphors
again! but metaphors expressive of distinct realities).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>His kingdom is “to come:” He will be hereafter recognized
as Almighty; He cannot be so recognized at present.</p>

<p class='c006'>I know very well that I can give no logical or consistent
account of this mysterious resistance to the Supreme God.
But I am led to recognize it, first, by the facts of the
visible world; secondly, by the plain teaching of Christ
Himself. Surely the authority of Christ must count for
something with Christians in their theorizing about the
origin of evil. Would not even an agnostic admit that as,
in poetry, I should be right in following the lead of a poet,
so in matters of spiritual belief (if I am to have any
spiritual belief at all) I am right in deferring to Christ? It
is a marvel to me how some Christians who find the
recognition of miracles inextricably involved in the life
and even in the teaching of Christ, nevertheless fail to
see, or at all events are most unwilling to confess, that the
recognition of an evil one, or Satan, is an axiom that underlies
all His doctrine. In the view of Jesus, it is Satan that
causes some forms of disease and insanity; Satan is the
author of temptation, the destroyer of the good seed, the
sower of tares, the “evil one”—so at least the text of
the Revisers tells us—from whom we must daily pray to
be delivered. The same belief pervades the writings
of St. Paul. Yet if you preach nowadays this plain
teaching of our Lord, the heterodox shrug their shoulders
and cry “Antediluvian!” while the orthodox think to
dispose of the whole matter in a phrase, “Flat Manichæism!”
But to the heterodox I might reply that
Stuart Mill (no very antiquated or credulous philosopher)
deliberately stated that it was more easy to believe in the
existence of an Evil as well as a Good, than in the
existence of one good and all-powerful God; and the
orthodox must, upon reflection, admit that in this doctrine
about Satan Christ’s own teaching is faithfully followed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of course if any one replies, “Christ was under an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>illusion in believing in the existence of Satan,” I have
no means of logically confuting him. But I think there
must be many who would say, with me: “If I am to have
any theory in matters of this kind which are entirely
beyond the sphere of demonstration, I would sooner
accept the testimony of Christ than the speculations of
all the philosophers that ever were or are. Christ was
possibly, or even probably, ignorant (in His humanity) of
a great mass of literary, historical, physiological, and
other scientific facts unknown to the rest of the Jews.
But we cannot suppose Him to be spiritually ignorant;
least of all, so spiritually ignorant as to attribute to the
Adversary what ought to have been attributed to God the
Father in Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It would be easy for you to shew that any theory of Satan
is absurdly illogical; nobody can be convinced of that
more firmly than I am already. Whether Satan was good
at first and became evil without a cause; or was good
at first and became evil from a certain cause (which presupposes
another pre-existing Satan); or was evil from the
beginning and created by God; or evil from the beginning
and not created by God—in all or any of these hypotheses
I see, as clearly as you see, insuperable difficulties. If
you cross-examine me, I shall avow at once a logical
collapse, after this fashion: “Were there then two First
Causes?” I believe not. “Did the Evil spring up after
the Good?” I believe so. “Did the first Good create
the Evil?”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a> I believe not. “Did the Evil then spring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>up without a cause?” I cannot tell. “Did the Good,
when He created the Goodness that issued in Evil, know
that he, or it, contained the germ of evil, and would soon
become wholly evil?” I do not believe this. “Whence
then came the Evil, or the germ of the Evil?” I do not
know. “Are you not then confessing that you believe,
where you know nothing?” Yes, for if I knew, there
would be no need to believe.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here you have a sufficiently amusing exhibition of inconsistency
and ignorance; but this seems to me of infinitely
little concern where I am dealing not with matters
that fall within the range of experience, but with spiritual
and supernatural things that belong to the realm of faith,
hope, and aspiration. I could just as easily turn inside
out my cross examiner if he undertook to give me a
scientific theory on the origin of the world. No doubt he
might prefer having no theory about the origin of the
world, and might recommend me to imitate him by
having no theory about the origin of Evil, or about
the nature of the Supreme Good. But my answer
would be as follows: “I have a certain work to do in
the world, and I cannot go on with my work without
having some theories on these subjects. Most men feel
with me that they must have some answer to these
stupendous problems of existence. As the senses are
intended to be our guide in matters of experience, so our
faculty of faith seems to me intended to guide us in matters
quite beyond experience.” There is another answer
which I hardly like to give because it seems brutal; but
I believe it to be true, and it is certainly capable of being
expressed in the evolutionary dialect so as to commend
itself to the scientific mind: “An agnostic nation will
find itself sooner or later unsuited for its environment, and
will either come to believe in some solution of these
spiritual problems or stagnate and perish. And something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>of the same result will follow from agnosticism in the
family and in the individual.”</p>

<p class='c006'>From this doctrine of Christ then I am not to be dislodged
by any philosophic analysis demonstrating that
good and evil so run into one another that it is impossible
to tell where one ends and the other begins. “Is all pain
evil? Is it an evil that a sword’s point pains you? Would
it not be a greater evil that a sword should run you through
unawares because it did not pain you? Is not the pain
of hunger a useful monitor? Has not pain in a thousand
cases its use as a preservative? Is not what you call
‘sin’ very often misplaced energy? If a child is restless
and talkative and consequently disobedient, must you consequently
bring in Satan to account for the little one’s
peccadilloes? If a young man is over-sanguine, reckless,
rash, occasionally intemperate, must all these faults be
laid upon the back of an enemy of mankind? Is animal
death from Satan, but vegetable death from God? And
is the death of a sponge a half and half contribution from
the joint Powers? And when I swallow an oyster, may I
give thanks to God? but when a tiger devours a deer, or
an eagle tears a hare, or a thrush swallows a worm, are
they doing the work of the Adversary? Where are you
to begin to trace this permeating Satanic agency? Go
back to the primordial atom. Are we to say that the Devil
impelled it in the selfish tangential straight line, and that
God attracts it with an unselfish centripetal force, and that
the result is the harmonious curve of actuality? If you
give yourself up to such a degrading dualism as this, will
you not be more often fearing Satan than loving God?
Will you not be attributing to Satan one moment, what
the next moment will compel you to attribute to God?
Where will you draw the line?” To all this my answer
is very simple: “I shall draw the line where the
spiritual instinct within me draws it. Whatever I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>forced to pronounce contrary to God’s intention I shall
call evil and attribute to Satan.” Herein I may go wrong
in details, and I may have to correct my judgments as I
grow in knowledge; but I am confident that, on the
whole, I shall be following the teaching of Christ. My
spiritual convictions accord with the teaching of that
ancient allegory in the book of Genesis, which tells us
that Satan, not God, brought sin and death into the world.
There was a Fall somewhere, in heaven perhaps as well as
on earth—“war in heaven” of the Evil against the Good—a
declension from the divine ideal, a lapse by which the
whole Universe became imperfect. It has been the work
of God, not to create death, but upon the basis of death
to erect a hope and faith in a higher life; not to create
sin, but out of sin, repentance, and forgiveness, to elicit a
higher righteousness than would have been possible (so we
speak) if sin had never existed. Similarly of disease, and
pain, and the conflict in the animal world for life and
death: good has resulted from them; yet I cannot think
of them, I cannot even think of change and decay, as
being, so to speak, “parts of God’s <i>first intention</i>.” Stoics,
and Christians who imitate Stoics, may call these things
“indifferent:” I cannot. And even if I could, what of
the ferocity, and cruelty, and exultation in destruction,
which are apparent in the animal world? “Death,” say
the Stoics, “is the mere exit from life.” Is it? I was
once present at a theatre in Rouen where the hero took a
full quarter of an hour to die of poison, and the young
Normans who sat round me expressed their strenuous
disapprobation: “C’est trop long,” they murmured. I
have made the same remonstrance in my heart of hearts,
ever since I was a boy and saw a cat play with a mouse,
and a patient stoat hunt down and catch at last a tired-out
rabbit: “It is too long,” “It is too cruel.” “Did
God ordain this?”—I asked: and I answered unhesitatingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“No.” These are but small phenomena in Nature’s
chamber of horrors: but for me they have always been,
and will always remain, horrible. I believe that God intends
us to regard them with horror and perhaps to see in
them some faint reflection of the wantonly destructive and
torturing instinct in man.</p>

<p class='c006'>Those are fine-sounding lines, those of Cleanthes:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>οἰδέ τι γίγνεται ἔργον ἐπὶ χθονὶ σου δίχα, δαῖμον,</div>
      <div class='line'>πλὴν ὅποσα ῥέζουσι κακοὶ σφετέρῃσιν ἀνοίαις.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>I should like to agree with them; but I cannot. The
picture of the cat and the mouse appears—fertile in suggestions.
“This at least,” I say, “was not wrought by
‘evil men in their folly;’ and yet it did not come direct
from God.” Isaiah pleases me better with his prediction,
physiologically absurd, but spiritually most true: “The
lion shall eat straw like a bullock.” That is just the confession
that I need: it comes to me with all the force
of a divine acknowledgment, as if God thereby said:
“Death and conflict must be for a time, but they shall not
be for ever: it was not my intention, it is not my will, that
my creatures should thrive by destroying each other.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Applying this theory to Evolution, I believe that Satan,
not God, was the author of the wasteful and continuous
conflict that has characterized it; but that God has
utilized this conflict for the purposes of development and
progress. This is what I had in my mind when I said
that Evolution diminished the difficulties in the way of
acknowledging the existence of a God. The problems
of death, destruction, waste, conflict and sin, are not new;
they are as old as Job, perhaps as old as the first-created
man; but it is new to learn that good has resulted from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>those evils. In so far as Evolution has taught this, it has
helped to strengthen, not to weaken, our faith. But then,
if we are to use this language, we must learn to think, not
of “Evolution by itself,” but of “Evolution with Satan.”
“Evolution without Satan” would appal us by the seeming
wastefulness and ubiquity of conflict and the indirectness
of its benefits; but “Evolution with Satan” enables us
to realize God as our refuge and strength amid the utmost
storms and tempests of destruction.</p>

<p class='c006'>If any one says that the belief in Satan is inexpedient,
I am ready to give him a patient hearing; but I find it
difficult to listen patiently to what people are pleased to
call arguments against it. For example, “Duty can exist
only in a world of conflict;” to which the reply is obvious,
“But God might have made men for love and harmonious
obedience, and not for duty and conflict.” This, of
course, is a very presumptuous statement, such as Bishop
Butler would have condemned; but it is a fitting reply to
a still more presumptuous implied statement. God has
revealed Himself as Righteousness and Goodness without
internal conflict; He has also revealed His purpose to
conform us to Himself; and the Bible speaks of Him as
being opposed by an Adversary who caused men for a
time to differ from the divine image; is it not then a very
presumptuous thing to imply that “God <i>could</i> not have
created men but for conflict and duty,” or, in other words,
“God <i>could</i> not have made us better than we are, even
had there been no Adversary opposing His will?” Again,
we hear it said that, “An evil Spirit contending against a
good Spirit must needs have produced two distinct worlds,
and not the one progressive world of which we have experience:”
to which the answer is equally obvious, “The
orbit of every planet, or the path of any projectile, shows
that two different forces may result in one continuous
curve.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>The only consistent and systematic way of rejecting a
belief in the existence of Satan is to reject the belief in
the existence of sin. Then you can argue thus, “The notion
of a Satan arises from the false and sharp antagonism
which our human imaginations set up between ‘good’
and ‘evil,’ whereas what we call ‘evil’ is really nothing
but an excess of tendencies good in themselves and only
evil when carried to excess. The difference therefore
between good and evil is only a question of degree.”
That theory sounds plausible; but it ignores the essence
of sin, which consists in a rebellion against Conscience.
It is not excess, or defect, the more, or the less; it is the
moral disorder, the subversion of human nature, which is
so frightful to contemplate that we cannot believe it to
have proceeded from God. But perhaps you reply, “That
very disorder is merely the result of energy out of place
or in excess.” Well, in the same way, when gas is
escaping in a room in which there is a lighted candle,
there is first a quiet and inoffensive escape of the gas,
and secondly a violent and perhaps calamitous explosion;
and you might argue similarly, “The difference was only
one of degree; the explosion was merely the result of a
useful element out of place and in excess.” But I should
answer that no sober and sensible householder would
justify himself in this way for allowing a lighted candle
and escaping gas to come together; and so I cannot
believe that God is willing that men should justify Him
for tolerating theft, murder, and adultery, on the ground
that these things are “only questions of degree.” I think
we please Him better, and draw closer to Him, when we
say, “An Enemy hath done this.” And besides, for our
own sakes, if we are to resist sin with our utmost force, it
seems to me we are far more likely to do so when we
regard it as Christ and St. Paul regarded it than when
we give it the name of “misplaced energy,” or “an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>excessive use of faculties, in themselves, good and
necessary.”</p>

<p class='c006'>To me it seems that if we are to have a genuine trust
in God, it is almost necessary that we should believe in
the existence of a Satan. I say “almost,” because there
may be rare exceptions. A few pure saintly souls, of inextinguishable
trust, may perhaps be able to face the awful
phenomena of Evil and to say, “Though He hath done all
this yet will we trust in Him; what may have moved Him
to cause His creatures to struggle together, and to thrive,
each on the destruction of its neighbour, we know not,
and we are not careful to know; our hearts teach us that
He is above us in goodness, and in wisdom, as in power;
we know that we must trust Him; more than this we do
not wish to know.” Such men are to be admired—but to
be admired by most of us at a great distance. For the
masses of men, and especially for those who know something
of the depth of sin, it must be a great and almost a
necessary help to say, “The Good that is done upon
Earth, God doeth it Himself; the evil that is upon earth
God doeth it not: an Enemy hath done this.”</p>

<p class='c006'>One evil resulting from the rejection of Christ’s doctrine
is that we consequently fail to understand much of His
life and sufferings. If Christ was really manifested that
He might destroy the works of the Devil, then much is
clear that is otherwise incomprehensible. There was then
no delusion nor insincerity in the parables of the Sower
and the Tares. God did not first cast the good seed and
then blow it away with His own breath. God did not sow
wheat with the right hand and tares with the left. “An
Enemy” had done the mischief. There was no fiction
when Jesus spent those long hours by night on the mountain
top in prayer. He needed help, and needed it sorely.
He was fighting a real battle. It was not the mere anticipation
of pains in the flesh, the piercing nails, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>parching thirst, the long-protracted death, that made the
bitterness of Christ’s passion. Even when He had regained
composure, and in perfect calm was going forth to
meet His death, we find Him declaring that Satan had
asked for one of his Apostles “to sift him as wheat”, and
implying that all His prayers were needed that the faith
of the tempted disciple should not “fail.” But in Gethsemane
the battle for the souls of men was still pending.
There was an Enemy who was pulling down His heart,
striving hard to make Him despair of sinful mankind,
perhaps to despair of we know not what more beyond;
forcing Him in the extremity of that sore conflict to cry
that He was “exceeding sorrowful even unto death,” and
afterwards, on the Cross, to utter those terrible words,
“My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” All
this is full of profound meaning, if there was indeed an
Enemy. But if there was no Enemy, what becomes of
the conflict? What meaning is left to the Crucifixion,
except as the record of mere physical sufferings, the like
of which have been endured, before and after, by thousands
of ordinary men and women?</p>

<p class='c006'>This belief in the existence of Satan appears to me to
be confirmed by daily present experience as well as by
the life of Christ. It “works.” It enables us, as no other
belief does, to go to the poor, the sick, the suffering, and
the sinful, and to preach Christ’s Gospel of the fatherhood
of God. All simple, straightforward people who
are acquainted with the troubles of life must naturally
crave this doctrine. If you ascribe to Providence the
work of Satan, they will consciously or unconsciously
identify Providence with the author of evil, and look to
One above to rescue them from Providence. Instead of
attempting to console people for all their evils by laying
them on the Author of Goodness, we ought to lay them
in part upon themselves, in part on the author of evil.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>“God, the Father in heaven, did not intend you to be
thus miserable”—thus we can begin our message—“your
sufferings come from an Enemy against whom He is contending.
Do not for a moment suppose that you are to
put up in this life with penury, disease, misery, and sin
as if these things came from God. Very often they are
the just punishments of your own faults, as when drunkenness
brings disease; but as the sin, so also the punishment,
was of Satan’s making, though God may use both
for your good. You are to be patient under tribulation;
you are to be made perfect through suffering; you are to
regard the trials and troubles of life as being in some sense
a useful chastisement proceeding from the fatherly hand
of God. But never let your sense of the need of resignation
lead you to attribute to the origination of God that
which Christ teaches us to have been brought into the world
by God’s adversary. Satan made these evils to lead men
wrong; God uses them to lead men right. Death, for example,
came from Satan, who would fain make us believe
that our souls perish with our bodies, that friends
are parted for ever by the grave, and that there is no
righteousness hereafter to compensate for what is wrong
here: but God uses death to make men sober, thoughtful,
steadfast, courageous, and trustful. It remains with
you to decide whether you will bear your evils so as
to succumb to the temptations of Satan, or so as to prevail
over them and utilize them to your own welfare and
to the glory of God. On which side will you fight? We
ask you to enlist on the side of righteousness.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I feel sure that this theory of life would commend itself
to the poor, that it would be morally advantageous to the
rich, and that it would be politically useful to the State.
There has been too prevalent a habit—among those believers
especially who ignore Satan and attribute all things
to God—of taking for granted that the social inequalities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and miseries of the lower classes which have come down
to us from feudal and non-Christian times, can never pass
away. I remember once in my boyhood how, when I
represented to a farmer that the condition of his labourers
was not a happy one, he met me with a text of Scripture,
“The poor shall never depart out of the land;” and that
seemed to him to leave no more to be said. It is this
provoking acquiescence of the comfortable classes in
the miseries of the suffering classes, which irritates the
latter into a disbelief of the religion that dictates so
great a readiness to see in the miseries of others a
divinely ordained institution.</p>

<p class='c006'>The time will soon come (1885) when the very poor will
demand a greater share in the happiness of life; and the
question will arise whether they can be helped to obtain
this by their own individual efforts or by the co-operation
of those of their own class, or by the State, or by the
Church. Caution must be shewn in trying experiments
with nations; but as some experiments will assuredly
have to be tried, it is most desirable in this crisis of our
history that the Church at all events should faithfully
follow Christ by regarding physical evil, not as a law of
fate, but as a device of Satan. If, by descending a step
or two lower in the scale of comfort, the comfortable
classes could lift the very poor a step or two higher,
the Church ought not to help the rich to shut their eyes
to their obvious duty by giving them the excuses of such
texts as “The poor shall never depart out of the land,”
or, “Man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.”
Poverty is often a good school: but penury is distinctly
an evil; and the Church should regard it as an evil not
coming from God, and should make war against it, and
teach the poor not to acquiesce in it. The Gospel of
Christ would be made more intelligible to the poorer
classes than it has been made for many centuries past, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>it could be preached as a war against physical as well as
moral harm. Such a crusade would call out and enlist
on the right side all the combative faculty in us; it would
inspire in us a passionate allegiance towards Christ, as
our Leader, desiring, asking, yes, and we may almost say,
needing our help in a real conflict in which His honour
as well as our happiness and highest interests are at
stake; it would attract the co-operation of all faculties in
the individual, of all classes in the country. In other
words the theory would work; and so far as a religious
theory works, so far have we evidence, present and intelligible
to all, that it contains truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have recently heard views similar to mine controverted
by an able theologian, who contended that, although they
professed to be illogical, they went beyond the bounds
even of the illogicality permissible in this subject. But
the controverter’s solution of the problem was this:
“<i>Evil is a part of God’s intention.</i> We have to fight,
with God, against something <i>which we recognise to be
His work</i>.” Is not this a “hard saying”? Is it not
harder than the saying of Christ, “An enemy hath done
this”? I say nothing about its being illogical and absurd:
but does it not raise up a new stumbling-block in the path
of those who are striving to follow Christ?</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be urged that the belief in Satan has been tested
by the experience of centuries and has been found to be
productive of superstition, insanity, and immorality; but
these evils appear to me to have sprung, not from the
belief in Satan, but from a superstitious, disorderly and
materialistic form of Christianity, which has perverted
Christ’s doctrine about the Adversary into a recognition
of a licensed Trafficker in Souls. The same materialistic
and immoral tendency has perverted Christ’s sacrifice into
a bribe. But, just as we should not reject the spiritual
doctrine of Christ’s Atonement, so neither should we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>reject the spiritual doctrine of an Evil in the world resisting
the Good, although both doctrines alike have been grossly
and harmfully misinterpreted.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of course it is possible that in our notions of spiritual
personality, and therefore in our personification of Satan,
we may be under some partial illusion. The subject
teems with difficulties; and I have not concealed from
you my opinion that some passages in the Old Testament
appear to support a view at variance with the tenour of
the New. The real truth, while justifying our Lord’s
language, may not accord with all our inferences as to its
meaning; and I should myself admit that it would be most
disastrous to attempt to personify the Adversary with the
same vividness with which we personify the Father in
heaven. Still,—in answer to the taunt of the agnostic or
sceptic, “Is this, or that, the work of the God whom
you describe as Love?”—I think we avail ourselves of
our truest and most effective answer, when we resolve to
separate certain aspects of Nature from the intention of
God, and to say, with Christ, “An enemy hath done
these things.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>
  <h2 id='let10' class='c004'>X <br /> ILLUSIONS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>I see you are still violently prejudiced against illusions,
that is to say against recognising the very important
part which they have played in the spiritual development
of mankind. You clearly believe that, though the world
may be full of illusions, Revelation ought to be free from
them. “The Word of God,” you say, “ought to dispel
illusions, not to add to them.” I maintain on the contrary,
that the Word of God, if it comes to earth, must
needs come in earthen vessels; and that the most divine
truth must needs be contained in illusion. Let illusions
then be the subject of my present letter. At the same
time I shall attempt to answer your prejudice against the
natural worship of Christ as being a “new religion”.
Not of course that I admit that it is a “new religion”;
on the contrary I regard it as the old religion, the
predestined God-determined religion to which we are to
return after extricating ourselves from the corruptions of
Protestantism, as our forefathers extricated themselves
from the corruptions of Romanism. I shall not deal
here with the special illusions of Christianity, but with
your evident <i>a priori</i> prejudice against any admixture of
illusion with Revelation.</p>

<p class='c006'>But first, what do I mean by “illusion,” and how does
my meaning differ from “error” or “mistake” generally,
and from “fallacy,” “delusion,” and “hallucination” in
particular? I say “my meaning,” because the word is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>often used loosely (I do not say wrongly) for any of these
synonyms: but I restrict it to a special sense.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Illusion,” then, is wholesome error tending to the
ultimate attainment of truth; “delusion” is harmful error
arising from a perverted Imagination; “hallucination” is
a wandering of the Imagination, without any guidance or
support of fact, involving “delusion” of the most obstinate
character; “fallacy” is an error of inference or reasoning;
“mistake” is the result of mal-observation or weak
memory; and “error” a general name for any deviation
from the truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Illusion, in many cases, is an exaggerative and ornative
tendency of the mind. It leads the very young to think
their parents perfection, and the young to think them far
better and wiser than they really are; it constrains the
lover to exaggerate the beauty, accomplishments, and
qualities of the woman whom he loves; it tends to the
distortion of history by inclining all of us to accommodate
facts to the wishes and preconceptions of our idealizing
nature, which is always longing for “a more ample greatness,
a more exact goodness, and a more absolute variety
than can be found in the nature of things”;<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a> and it lures
us onward, young and old alike, over the rough places of
life, even to the very brink of the grave, by the ever-fleeting,
ever-reappearing suggestions of a bright to-morrow
that shall make amends for the dull and commonplace
to-day.</p>

<p class='c006'>These illusive hopes, beliefs, and aspirations are never
fulfilled in this life; but even the cynic and the pessimist
must acknowledge, with Francis Bacon, that they constitute
the very basis of all poetry that “tends to magnanimity and
morality.” Those who believe in God will further
recognize in illusion a divinely utilized integument for the
preservation and development of aspirations that shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>ultimately find a perfect fulfilment in a harmonious co-operation
with the divine Love and in the unending contemplation
of the divine Glory. Nor are illusions without
a present practical purpose. Men are more hopeful, more
active, more loving on account of them. On the other
hand, even optimists must acknowledge that no man should
shut his eyes to the truth in order to remain in what he
knows to be no more than a comfortable error. The venial
illusions of childhood, youth, and ignorance, become unpardonable
or hypocritical in experienced age. Do you
ask how we are to distinguish “illusions” from “delusions”?
The answer is easy—on paper; but, in practice, often difficult
to apply. However, the test is the same as that by
which we distinguish knowledge from ignorance. Illusions
“work”; that is to say, men are on the whole the better
for them, and they prepare the way for truth. Delusions
fail; men are in no way the better for them, and they often
prepare the way for insanity and for physical or spiritual
death.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have spoken of moral illusions; let us touch on
another kind of illusions to which some (I do not say
rightly) have given the name of “illusions of sense.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I doubt whether the name is correctly given; for to me
it seems that the illusion proceeds not from the senses
(which, as far as I can judge, never deceive us) but from
the imaginations and inferences which we base upon the
report of the senses. Take an extreme case, fit rather to
be called “delusion” than “illusion.” If I see the phantom
of a cat before the fire, which cat nobody else in the
room can see, do my senses deceive me? No; but I am
deceived by the imaginative inference which leads me to
assume from past experience that the object which I see
is visible to, and can be touched by, everybody else. My
visual sense (which has to do with images only) reports—and
can do no otherwise—that it discerns the image of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>cat. That report is true. But then my imagination forces on
me the belief that this is an ordinary tangible and visible cat.
That belief is false. Or take again the not infrequent case
of colour-blindness. I am a signalman, and cannot tell a
green light from a red: do my senses deceive me when I
call a red light green? No; my sense reports inadequately
for my necessities, and coarsely is compared with
those who possess a finer sense of colour, but not deceitfully.
My error arises from having loosely and servilely
used the distinctive words “red” and “green” from childhood
to manhood, although my senses continually protested
that they could not distinguish two colours corresponding
to the two words: but I imagined that there must be some
such distinction for the two, and that I must be capable
of recognizing it, because everybody around me recognized
it. If we are to say that the signalman’s senses deceive
him we must be prepared to admit that every man’s senses
deceive him more or less. Do you suppose, when you see
anything, that you see that which the thing <i>is</i>? “This is
a yellowish-green,” say you. “Of course,” a Superior
Being might reply; “but which of the one hundred and
fifty shades of yellowish-green is it? You might as well
tell me, when I shew you a sheep, ‘This is a <i>being</i>,’ as tell
me simply this is ‘yellowish-green.’” We do not see
things as Superior Beings see them; but we are not on
that account to say that our sight deceives us. Our visual
sense reports the truth more or less adequately: but our
Imagination, prompted by insufficient experience and
inference, leads us sometimes to illusive conclusions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Still, although “illusions of sense” ought perhaps to be
rather called “illusions <i>from</i> sense;”—<i>i.e.</i> illusions arising
“from” the report of the senses, but not illusions in which
the senses are themselves deceived—no one will deny that
such illusions exist. Sometimes they are exceptional, but
sometimes so common as to be almost universal. Let us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>enumerate a few and ask whence they spring, and what
purpose they serve?</p>

<p class='c006'>They spring from a very strong conviction—erected
upon the basis of Experience by Faith, but absolutely
necessary for healthy life and spontaneous action—that
the ordinary inferences which we almost instinctively
derive from the report of the senses, are true, that is to
say, will correspond to experience; and that we can act
upon them without formally reasoning upon them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Take the following instance. Shut your eyes, and get
a friend to prick the back of your hand with the two points
of a pair of compasses simultaneously, so that the two
points may be about the eighth of an inch apart when they
touch you; you will feel—and if you could not correct the
inference by the sense of sight, you would infer—that only
one point is pricking you. The reason is that the skin
of the back of the hand only reports one sensation; and
the mind leaps to the conclusion—owing to the multitude
of past instances where one sensation has resulted from
one object—that, in this instance also, one object alone is
producing the sensation. A more curious instance is
the following: Place the middle finger over the first finger,
and between the two fingers thus interlaced place a
single marble or your nose: you will appear to be touching
two marbles or two noses. The reason is this: when the
two fingers are in their usual position (not thus interlaced)
and touching marbles or similar objects, two simultaneous
sensations on the right side of the right finger and on the
left side of the left finger would always imply <i>two</i> marbles;
now you have constrained the two fingers to assume an
unusual position where these two simultaneous sensations
can be produced by <i>one</i> marble; but you, following custom,
would infer the presence of two marbles, if sight, or other
evidence, did not shew there was only one.</p>

<p class='c006'>But illusions from the sense of touch are far less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>common than illusions from the sense of sight. We all
know how a cloud or sheet or coal may be converted by the
Imagination into an image of something entirely different
and visible only to the imaginer, although he supposes
that others “must see it” too. But these are, so to speak,
private illusions: the great public and, at one time, universal
illusion, was the conviction that the sun and the
stars move and that the earth does not move. There is
scarcely any illusion more natural than this. Our senses
give no indication whatever of the earth’s motion; but
they do indicate that the sun and the stars are moving.
So complicated a process of reasoning, and so much experience,
are needed before a man can realize (as distinct
from repeating on authority) the causes for believing in the
earth’s motion that it is by no means surprising that, even
now, only a minority of the human race believe that they
are dashing through space at the rate of some thousands
of miles an hour; and, except during the last three hundred
years, the illusion that the earth is at rest was universal.
Another common illusion from sight is that which leads
us to suppose that, when we see anything in the air, a
straight line from our eye towards the image which we
see would touch the object itself: whereas, in reality, the
image is raised by refraction so that in misty weather we
see an object considerably higher than it is, and I suppose
(to speak with strict exactness) we never “see” an object
precisely where it is.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have mentioned a few of the “illusions from the
senses”; and now you will probably ask me what purpose
they serve, how they can be called “wholesome,” and
how they “tend to the ultimate attainment of truth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They appear to me to be “wholesome” because they
represent and spring from a wholesome belief that
“Nature will not deceive us; Nature does not change
her mind; Nature keeps her promises.” Sent into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>world with but little of the instinctive equipment of non-human
animals, we are forced to supply the place of instincts
by inferences from sensation. Now if we were
always obliged consciously to argue and deliberately to
infer, whenever the sensations hand over a report to the
Imagination, we should be at a great disadvantage as
compared with our instinct-possessing compeers, whom
we call irrational. “This inkstand which I see before me
was hard yesterday, and the day before—but will it be
hard if I touch it to-day or to-morrow?”—if a child were
to argue after this fashion every time he reached out his
hand to touch anything, the life of Methuselah would be
too short for the ratiocinations necessary as a basis for the
action of a week. For healthy progress of the human being,
trustful activity is needed, and for trustful activity we
must trust Nature, or, in other words, we must trust these
quasi-instinctive inferences about Nature which we derive
from our sensations. This trust or faith in the order of
material things within our immediate observation, I have
already described as being the germ of a trust or faith in a
higher order altogether, that universal order, at present
imperfectly realized, which we call the Divine Will.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now when we say to Nature, “We trust you; you will
not deceive us,” Nature replies for the most part, “You
do right; I will not deceive you; you will be justified in
your faith.” But occasionally she replies in a different
tone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I have deceived you; you did not use the
means you had of obtaining the truth; therefore you deceived
yourselves, or, if you please to say so, I deceived
you, in order that, after deceiving yourselves by a prolonged
experience, you might learn, while trusting my
order and permanence in general, not to trust every conception
of your own about that order and permanence in
particular.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“Yet in reality, what you call my ‘deceptions’ were, in
part, the results of your own defects (some blameworthy,
some perhaps inherent and not blameworthy), in part the
results of my method of teaching mankind, by line upon
line and inference upon inference. How does a child gain
knowledge? By generalizing from too few instances: by
inferring too soon; then by enlarging the circle of instances
from which he generalizes; by correcting his
inferences with the aid of experience: thus the progress
of every child towards truth is through a continuous series
of illusions. But when I break each one of your false and
rudimentary conceptions of my Order, I always reveal to
you, concealed in the husk of it, the kernel of a better conception.
Thus while I teach you daily to distrust your
own hastily adopted and unverified assumptions or inferences
about my Order, I give you no cause to distrust
my Order itself; and by the self same act I strengthen
both your faculty of scientific reason and also your faith
in me. You may find fault with me that I did not bestow
on each one of you, even in the cradle, the perfection of
all knowledge and wisdom. Deeper laws, deeper than I
can now speak of, forbade that rapid consummation:
but, since that could not be, since it needs must be that
imperfection should be in the intellectual, as well as in
the moral, world, rejoice at least that illusion is made
subject to truth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Well, after this long but needful account of “illusions,”
in the sense in which I use the term, let me now recur to
your objection that “the Word of God ought to dispel
illusions, not to add to them.” I suppose those who
believe in a God at all, will in these days regard Him
as the Maker of the world, as a whole, in spite of the evil
that is in it. Some of the Gnostics, as you know, believed
that the good God who had <i>not</i> made the visible world
was opposed to the bad God who had made it; but with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>them we need not at this time concern ourselves, as there
are probably none who now entertain that belief. Those
then who believe in a God, Maker of heaven and earth,
will not deny that God partially reveals Himself to men
by the things He has made. Now by which of all His
creatures does God reveal Himself most clearly? You
will say perhaps—indeed I have heard you say it—“By
the stars and their movements.” I do not believe it. I
say, “By the life of the human family first and by the
stars of heaven, second. But I will assume that your
answer is correct, and that God reveals Himself mainly
by the movements of the stars of heaven; and I will try
to shew you that in this revelation God leads men to truth
through illusion. Then I think it must seem reasonable
to you that, if God does not dispense with illusion in that
intellectual revelation of Himself which most closely
approaches to a direct spiritual revelation, illusion may
also have been intended or permitted by Him to play an
ordained part in spiritual revelation itself.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Where, then, I ask, in all the teaching of Nature’s
school, has there been more of illusion than in her
lessons of astronomy? When I was a boy, I remember,
in the midst of a hateful sum of long division that would
not come out right, devoting my attention to the sun
moving through the branches of certain trees, and announcing
to my tutor that “The sun moves.” “No, you
are mistaken.” “But I cannot be mistaken, for I saw it.”
I rivalled—I exceeded—the obstinacy of Galileo; I was
ready to be punished rather than consent to say what
seemed to me a manifest falsehood, that the sun did not
move. Surely this boyish experience represents the experience
of mankind, except that the tutor who has corrected
their astronomical illusions, has been their own long, very
long experience. Does it not seem sometimes as if God
Himself had said, when He made the heavens to declare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>His glory, “Being what they are, my children must be led
to knowledge through error, to truth through illusion”?
It may be said that in some cases men have fallen into
astronomical mistakes through their own fault; through
haste, for example, through the love of neat and complete
theories, through carelessness, through excessive regard
for authority; and so indeed they have. But is it always
so? When you and I last walked out together on
Hampstead Heath, you took out your watch, as the sun
went down over Harrow, and said, “Now he’s gone, and
it’s just eight.” I remember replying to you, “So it
seems; but of course you know he ‘went’ more than
eight minutes ago.” You stared, and I said no more; for
something else diverted your attention at the time, and I
felt I had been guilty of a little bit of pedantry. But I
said quietly to myself as we went down the hill, “I
don’t suppose he knows it, but the sun certainly ‘went’
eight minutes ago; and what my young friend saw was an
image of the sun raised by the refraction of the mist, like
the image of a penny seen in a basin of water.” Well
now, was this your fault, this error of yours? No, it was,
in the second place, the fault of the University of Oxford,
which has bribed the schools to desist from teaching
mathematics to any boy with a taste for classics and
literature, so that you had to give up your mathematical
studies before you came to optics; and it was, in the
first place, the fault of—what shall I say? Shall I say the
fault of Nature? That means the fault of God. Say, if
you like, that it was the fault of Matter, or of an Evil
principle. Say, it was no one’s fault. Say that more
good than harm results from it, in the way of stimulating
thought and research. Deny it was a fault at all. Yet
do not deny that it represents a Law, the Law of the
attainment of truth through illusion—a Law which it is
folly to ignore.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>So far I have been going on the assumption that your
answer was correct as to the means by which God mainly
reveals Himself. But now let us assume that my answer,
and not yours, is correct, and that God reveals Himself
mainly by the relations of the family. In that case we
must agree that each rising generation is led up to the
conception of the divine fatherhood mainly by the preliminary
teaching of human fatherhood. Now surely in
the domestic atmosphere refraction is as powerful and as
illusive as in the material strata of the air. Nay, the
better and purer the family, the stronger is the illusion.
Unloving children may be logical and critical; but what
loving child does not idealise a good mother as perfectly
good, and a strong wise father as the perfection of wisdom
and strength? To the good child the parents stand in the
place of God; and it is his illusive belief in these earthly
creatures, which, when it has been corrected and purified,
is found to have contained and preserved the higher belief
in the eternal Father. You see then that in the family
no less than in science, in the spiritual as in the intellectual
side of Nature’s school, the pupils pass upwards through
illusion to the truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have promised to say nothing of the special illusions
of Christianity which I must reserve for a later letter.</p>

<p class='c006'>But let me say thus much from the <i>a priori</i> ground on
which we are now standing, that <i>if</i> illusions in Nature are
most powerful in her noblest and most spiritual teaching,
then, so far from there being a prejudice <i>against</i> finding
illusion in religion, <i>we ought on the contrary to be prepared
to find illusion most potent</i> in the early stages of the
purest religion of all. Was ever people so illusively trained
as the faithless children of faithful Abraham, the rejected
Chosen People? Is not the Promised Land to this day a
proverbial type of illusion? Do we not recognize illusion
in every age of Christian revelation? And if the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Apostles of the Lord Jesus—so much I will here assume—had
their illusions both during, and after, the life of their
Master; if the early Christians had their illusions also
concerning the speedy coming of Christ; if in the Mediæval
Church and in the later Roman Catholicism there
have predominated vast illusions about transubstantiation,
the powers of the priesthood, and the infallibility
of the Pope; if the Protestant Churches themselves
have not been exempt from illusions about the literal inspiration
and absolute infallibility of the Bible; is it not
the mark of astounding presumption to suppose that for
the Anglican branch of the Reformed Church there should
have been reserved a unique immunity from an otherwise
universal law?</p>

<p class='c006'>But possibly you think that the Gospels have been so
long in our hands, and the Christian religion so long in
practice and under discussion, that nothing new can now
be said or thought about them? Just so Francis Bacon, in
1603, expressed his conviction (the innocent philosopher!)
that there had at last come about a complete “consumption
of all things that could be said on controversies
of theology.” Reflect a moment. How long have the
stars been with us “under discussion”? And how recent
have been our discoveries of the real truth about them!
How recently have these discoveries been even possible?
In the same way the exact criticism of the New Testament
has only become recently practicable. The subject matter
and thought could of course be appreciated centuries ago,
and often perhaps by the simple-minded and unlearned as
well as by the subtle and profound theologian; though,
even as to the thought of the New Testament, I often
think that we are greatly to blame if our increased
knowledge of history and psychology does not illuminate
much that was dark in its pages for those who had not
our advantages. But we are speaking of that kind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>intellectual criticism which dispels illusions; and for the
purposes of the critical analysis of the First Three
Gospels, Bruder’s Concordance was as necessary as
Galileo’s telescope was for the discovery of Jupiter’s
moons, or the thermometer for the investigation of the
laws of heat. Other influences have been at work, as
well as mere mechanical aids, to throw light on the
central event of the world’s history. And surely if
Abraham could wait nineteen hundred years for the
coming of Christ, the spiritual descendants of Abraham—for
such we claim to be—may well wait another nineteen
hundred years to realize His nature and enter into
the full meaning of His worship.</p>

<p class='c006'>You see I am not now trying to prove the existence of
any illusion in our present form of Christianity; I am
simply <i>arguing against your prejudice</i> that, if the present
form of Christianity be not true, then any new form must
necessarily be false. You say, or perhaps till lately you
were inclined to say, “If I could only breathe the atmosphere
of Augustine! If only I could have been a
companion of the Ante-Nicene or (better still) of the
Apostolic Fathers! Or (best of all) of the Apostles! Or
of Christ Himself! Then I should have been free from
illusions.” I reply, “No, you would not; and your aspiration
is a mark of ingratitude to God. You deliberately
reject the commentary He has given you in the History
of the Church during these eighteen centuries. You
think the story of Christ is completely told and completely
explained. It is not so. All the created world is intended
to bear witness and illustration to His life and
work. Shakespeare and Newton and Darwin, as well
as Origen, Augustine, and Chrysostom, have added to the
divine commentary. All the good and all the evil of
eighteen hundred years have borne witness to the divine
nature of His mission; to the impotence and ruin which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>await the nations that cast Him off; to the blessing that
attends those who follow His Spirit; to the mischief that
dogs those who substitute for His Spirit a lifeless code of
rules or a fabric of superstitions.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And now one last word as to the special illusion from
which (in my belief) we must in the short remnant of this
century strive to deliver ourselves. I think we have
worshipped Christ too much as God, and too little as Man.
We have erroneously supposed that He exempted Himself
during His manhood from the laws of humanity.
Like the Roman soldiers, we have stripped from Him the
carpenter’s clothes, and put upon Him the purple rags of
wonder-working imperialism, and placed in His hand the
sceptre of worldly ostentation, and in that guise we have
bowed the knee to the purple and the sceptre, and, doing
homage to these things, we have cried, “Behold our
God.” But now the time has come when we must take
from off Him these tawdry trappings, and give Him back
His workman’s garments. Then we may find ourselves
constrained to bow the knee again in a purer homage
offered no longer to the clothes but to the Man.</p>

<p class='c006'>Call this homage by what name we will, it is already of
the nature of worship. And as we grow older and more
able to distinguish the realities from the mirage of life,
more capable of trust, love, and reverence, and better
able to discriminate what must be, and what must not be,
loved, trusted, and revered—looking from earth to heaven,
and from heaven to earth, we shall ask in vain where we
can find anything, above or below, nobler, and better,
and more powerful for good, than this Man to whom
our hearts go forth in spontaneous love and trust and
reverence. Then we shall turn once more to the Cross
finding that we have been betrayed into worship while
we knew it not, and while we cry, “Behold the Man,”
we shall feel “Behold our God.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>
  <h2 id='let11' class='c004'>XI <br /> WHAT IS WORSHIP?</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>Admitting the doctrine of illusion, and dismissing
all prejudice against what is new, you declare that still my
position remains absolutely unintelligible to you. I will
set down your objection in your own words: “Apparently
you maintain that Christ is a mere man who came into
the world, lived, worked, and died according to the laws
of human nature; even His resurrection you apparently
intend to explain away till it becomes a mere vision, and
therefore not a sign of any other than a human existence.
Now worship is a tribute conceded to God alone. To a
mere man, who lived eighteen centuries ago, how can you
force yourself, by any effort of the will, to pay worship
simply because you have reason to believe that this
individual was pre-eminently good”?</p>

<p class='c006'>In reply, I ask you, “What else is more worthy of
worship?” There is no question of “forcing myself”
at all. I worship Christ naturally. That is to say I love,
trust, and reverence Him more than I love, trust, and
reverence any other person or thing or universe of things.
This I do because I cannot help it; and if I have brought
myself to do this naturally by fixing my thoughts on the
power of Goodness, and on Christ as the incarnate
representation of Goodness, this causes me no shame
and involves me in no conflict with my Reason.</p>

<p class='c006'>But you—have you not omitted some important features
in the description of this “mere man”? Jesus was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>only pre-eminently good, He was also pre-eminently
powerful and wise for spiritual purposes. His influence
regenerated the civilized world; it is manifest around
us. He Himself spoke of Himself in language which
shews that He believed Himself to be endowed with a
divine authority over men, and to stand in a unique
relation to God. In a fanatic or a fool that would mean
nothing: in one so wise, so soberly wise, so utterly
unselfish, so marvellously successful, it must needs count
for much. Although I reject the miraculous, I do not
reject—nor understand how any one can reject—the
supernatural. I regard Jesus as being a “mere man”
indeed, if by “mere man” you mean a “real man”; non-miraculous,
subjected to all the material limitations of
humanity; but still a man such as is described in the first
chapter of the Fourth Gospel; the Word of God incarnate;
the Man in whom was concentrated God’s expression of
Himself; the Divine Perfection made humanly perceptible.
This I believed once upon the authority of the
Fourth Gospel; but I believe it now on the testimony of
history and my own conscience.</p>

<p class='c006'>Put yourself in my place. Suppose, as I suppose, that
Christ was what He was, and did what He did, naturally
and without miracles. Does not that make His personality
in a certain sense more wonderful and certainly
more lovable? It is comparatively easy, with miracles
at command, to persuade men to anything; but, without
miracles, to introduce a new religion, to bring in a new
power of forgiving sins, to offer up one’s life, not for friends,
nor for country, but for mankind, to manifest oneself so
to one’s disciples during life that after your death they
shall see you and shall be convinced that you have
triumphed over death; to disarm an armed world by non-resistance,
and to breathe a spirit of enthusiasm for
righteousness and a passionate love of mankind into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>myriads of a remote posterity—these surely are feats
which, if natural, should make us exclaim, “Verily we
have here a divine nature.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I trust I am not being goaded into any exaggeration of
what I really feel, by the hope of inducing you to share
my feelings. Perhaps it is not possible to worship any
man, not even such a one as Jesus, as long as he remains
in the flesh. Not till death takes a friend from us do we
seem to know the real spirit that lay behind the flesh and
blood; not till Jesus was taken from us could that Spirit
come which was to reveal the real Being that underlay
the humanity of the Nazarene. I will admit that I should
not have worshipped Jesus of Nazareth on earth—in
Peter’s house for example at Capernaum; for though love
might have been present, the trust and awe that were to be
developed by His resurrection would have been wanting.
Jesus does not claim our worship nor even our recognition,
as an isolated being, but as inseparably linked to One without
whom He Himself said He could “do nothing”. It was
not till He was removed from the visible world and
enthroned in the hearts of men by the side of the Father,
that men could perceive His real nature; and He is to
be worshipped not by Himself, but as the Son of God,
and one with God. Christ did not merely <i>tell</i> us about
the Father; He revealed the Father <i>in Himself</i>; and, if
we worship the Father as Christ revealed Him, we are,
consciously or unconsciously, worshipping the Son.</p>

<p class='c006'>Almost all language about all spiritual existences is
necessarily metaphorical. What is “righteousness”
except a <i>straightness</i>, and what is “excellence” except
<i>pre-eminence</i>? The proposition “Christ is the Son of
God” is a metaphor; it is a metaphor to say that “God
is our Father in heaven,” and that “God is Love.”
Perhaps even to say that “God <i>is</i>” is a metaphor, expressing
a truth, but expressing it inadequately. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>it would be the ignorance of a mere child to suppose
that a metaphor means nothing. There is no deeper
truth in heaven or earth than the metaphor that God is
the Father of man, and that the Lord Jesus Christ is His
Eternal Son. When I try to think of God and to pray to
God as my Father, I can think of Him as being without
the seas, without the stars, without the whole visible world;
but I can never think of Him aright, nor ever conceive of
Him as being Love, without conceiving also of One whom
He loves, who is with Him from the beginning; whom
when I try to realize, I can realize only in one shape;
and hence it comes to pass that I find myself without
any “effort of the will,” spontaneously worshipping God
through, and in, and with, that one shape, I mean the
Lord Jesus Christ. Worshipping the Father I find that
I have been unconsciously worshipping, and must
consciously continue to worship, the Eternal Son.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there is another difference between us, besides
your failure to recognise the spiritual power and spiritual
wisdom of Christ. You do not know what you mean by
worship; you do not know what you ought to worship;
and you do not know how little you know of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>You tell me that “worship is a tribute conceded to
God alone.” But what is God? The absolute God no one
knows. Our most perfect conception of Him is only a
conception of a Mediator of some kind by which we
approach Him. To each man, that which he worships,
and that alone, is God. I worship Christ, therefore to me
Christ is God. What will you say to that? I suppose
you will say “A non-miraculous Christ <i>ought not to be</i>
God to you”? Why not? How does He differ from your
conception of God? Is He less loving, less merciful, less
just? “No,” you reply, “but He is less powerful.” “How
is He less powerful? Has He less power of pitying, loving,
forgiving, raising men from sin to righteousness? Is He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>less powerful in the spiritual world?” “Perhaps not; but
He is less powerful in the material world. He never, according
to your account, rose above, never even for a moment
suspended the laws of nature.” Indeed? And God, the
Maker of the world—did He ever rise above, or suspend
the laws of nature? When? “Well, He is said to have
done so frequently in the records of the Bible”. But
many men deny that, and you yourself are disposed to
agree with them. “At all events He did so when He
made the world.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here at last we can come to an understanding. You
look up to God as to the Maker of the world, and are
more ready to worship Him, as such, than to worship a
non-miraculous Christ. If by “the Maker of the world”
you mean—as I am quite sure many mean—“the Maker
of the mere material forces of Nature,” or even “the
Maker of <i>all things apart from Christ</i>,” then words fail
me to express how entirely I differ from you. But let
me try to put your view into my own language, in
order to shew you that I do not condemn it without
understanding it. “We cannot,” you say, “worship a
mere non-miraculous man, who did nothing but talk and
lead a good life, and perhaps perform a few acts of faith-healing,
however beneficial may have been his influence
on posterity. The fact that, after his death, visions of him
were seen by excited and enthusiastic followers, and in
one case by an enemy of highly emotional tendencies,
cannot alter this decision. It is impossible to worship a
being so helpless, so limited, so aweless as this. What is
such a creature in comparison with the mysterious Maker
of the stars or Ruler of the ocean? Surely the sight of
a storm at sea ought to suffice to turn any one from the
imaginary and self-deceiving worship of the merely human
Jesus of Nazareth to the worship of One whose greatness
and glory and terror surround us on every side with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>material witnesses, One in comparison with whom no
mere man may be mentioned.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Natural as such an argument may seem to you and to
many others who call themselves Christians, it is in reality
based upon a diabolical prejudice in favour of power. I
can understand our forefathers, worshippers of Thor and
Odin, arguing thus; and so great is our own inherited
and inbred admiration of mere force, that even to us
Christians the temptation is still very strong to bow down
before the whirlwind and the fire, rather than before the
still small voice. But it is a temptation to be resisted and
overcome. You call upon me to worship the Ruler of the
waves. Now the sea is full of the gifts of God to men;
yet if I knew nothing more of the Creator than that
He had made and rules the sea, then—with all the
knowledge of the death and destruction that reign beneath
the depths of ocean among its non-human tenants, and
of the destruction that reigns on its surface when it wages
war against man and conquers—I should say, “So far as
the sea alone reveals the nature of Him who made it, I
would a thousand times sooner worship Jesus of Nazareth,
the non-miraculous man, than the Maker of the ocean.”
It is the most vulgar and contemptible cowardice to cringe
before the Maker of the destroying ocean—who might be
the Devil and not a good God, so far as the ocean’s
destructive power reveals its Maker—rather than to do
homage to the best of men. I grant that in a storm at
sea, with the lightning blinding my eyes, and the pitiless
waters tearing my companions from my side and
threatening every instant to devour me—I grant that I
might, and should, feel tempted to exclaim, “A mightier
than Christ is here.” But if I did, I should be ashamed
of it. It would be a traitorous tendering of allegiance to
Satan. When force and terror and death come shrieking
on the wave-crests, and proclaiming that “Power after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>all is Lord of the world,” then is our faith tested; it is
“the victory of our faith” to overcome that lie and to
make answer thus: “No, Goodness is Lord over the
world; Love is Lord over the world; and therefore He
who is one with Love and Goodness, the Lord Jesus
Christ, He is Lord over the world. Do with me as thou
wilt, thou Mighty Maker of all things! If Christ was not
deceived, thou art His Father and I can trust thee. But
if Christ was deceived, then art thou Satan and I defy
thee, be thou the Maker of a world of worlds. Better to
perish and be deceived with Christ, than to be saved and
caressed by a Maker who made Christ to perish and to
be deceived! If there be in truth any opposition of will
between the Maker and the Lord Jesus Christ, then is
the Lord Jesus the superior of the two; and in the Lord
Jesus alone will I put my trust, and to Him alone will
I cleave as my Lord and my Saviour and my God.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Have I made my meaning clear to you? I do not say,
Have I persuaded you that I am right? But have I made
you understand that it really is possible for one who has
apprehended even imperfectly the illimitable extent of
the goodness of Christ and the divine nature of that
goodness, to feel heartily and sincerely that, of all things
in heaven and earth and in the waters under the earth,
the goodness and power and wisdom of God in Christ are
the fittest objects for our love, our trust and our reverence,
in other words, for our worship? Can you name any
fitter object? If you will not worship God in the man
Jesus, you will hardly worship Him in Socrates, or Paul,
or any other specimen of humanity. Will you then turn
to inanimate nature, and worship him in that? Then you
will be turning from the higher to the lower conception
of God. Before I knew Christ, I might perhaps have
worshipped God the Maker, being led to him, so to
speak, by the world as Mediator. Inspired by awe for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the Creator of so vast and orderly a machine, I might
have adored Him as the artificer of the stars and this
terrestrial globe. But now, Christ has made this kind
of “natural religion” impossible. He, the ideal Man,
has revealed to me depths of love, pity, mercy, self-sacrifice,
in comparison with which the ocean is but the
“water in a bucket,” and the stars of heaven are as “a
very little thing.” If therefore I try to conceive of God
as alien and apart from Christ, God becomes at once
degraded and inferior to man.</p>

<p class='c006'>How shall I try to express myself more clearly? Let
me use words not my own, in which a man of recognized
ability once summed up for me my own conceptions; “I
see,” he said, “you do not, as most do, worship Christ
out of compliment to God; you worship God out of compliment
to Christ.” The words then sounded to me a
little profane, though they were not meant to be so; but
I had to confess that they exactly expressed my meaning.
Since then, it has seemed to me that these words were but
an incisive way of saying, what every one says and
few realize, that Christ is the Mediator between us and
God: we worship God the Father because we attribute
to Him the character that we adore in God the Son.</p>

<p class='c006'>By this time you will have seen that while answering
the question, “Whom, or what, ought we to worship?” I
have indirectly answered a preliminary question, “What
do we mean by worship?” You have also probably
noticed what answer I have given to this question:
worship appears to me a combination of love, trust, and
awe. Do you accept this? I have never seen any serious
objection taken to this definition except by those who
refuse practically to define it at all and who would simply
say “Worship is the homage paid by man to the Creator:
and it has nothing to do with, and cannot be explained
by, the feelings with which we regard man.” If I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>not seen this in the columns of a theological journal, I
should not have believed it possible that modern superficiality
and conventionalism could achieve quite so transparent
a shallowness. The sum total of our feelings
towards God—more especially our awe for Him—cannot
indeed be adequately expressed in the same language
which expresses our feelings for men: but that is a very
different thing from saying that the former “have nothing
to do with” the latter. I believe that a large part of most
men’s worship consists of a shrinking from an Unknown,
the sort of dread that children feel for “the dark.” But
righteous worship must imply other feelings; and these
feelings—some of them at all events—must have names;
and whence are the names to be derived but from our
feelings towards men and things—towards men, surely, as
well as towards things? We must either love God, or hate
Him, or be indifferent to Him; we must either trust, or distrust
Him. I do not see how the people who would sever
worship from all reference to human relations can look
upon it as other than a mere homage of the lips or knees,
a going to church, and attendance at religious services.
Need I say that, when I define worship, I am defining the
worship of the heart, not the attitude of those who honour
God with their lips but whose heart is far from Him?</p>

<p class='c006'>Now the attitude of man to God has varied greatly in
accordance with their conception of God, according as
they have conceived Him to be Moloch, or Apollo, or
Jehovah, or the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ. In
some men worship has been mere terror; in some, it has
been a desire to bribe; in some it has been faint gratitude
and strong admiration; in some it has been intense awe
and reverence. All such forms of worship have been imperfect,
and some have been very bad. At the best, none
of them have combined all the best and noblest feelings of
aspiration which Nature tends to develop in us by means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>of human and non-human agencies. Human nature—acting
through the relations of the family—should elicit
love and loving trust; non-human nature—acting through
the seas and skies, with their suggestions of vastness and
power—should elicit awe and awful trust; and the combination
of these two natural influences should elicit love,
trust and awe, which three-fold result constitutes worship.</p>

<p class='c006'>Has the worship of God through the mediation of
Christ entirely superseded—was it intended to supersede—the
worship of God through the mediation of the
visible World? I think not yet. It will in the end
but not now. There may come a time, in some future
existence, when we shall see righteousness like the sun,
when we shall have visions of the beauty and order of holiness
like the stars, and behold the glory of sacrifice spread
out before our eyes like the firmament of heaven; and
then the revelation of God through visible Nature will be
swallowed up in the revelation of God through invisible
Nature. But now, not many of us can pretend to such a
power of spiritual insight. We feel that, if we learned
the story of Christ without the help of the commentary of
the awful powers of material nature, we might be in
danger of repeating it with a glib familiarity which would
hinder us from penetrating its meaning. Those who live
in the stir of cities where they are doomed never to be alone,
never to realize perfect silence, never to see more than a few
square feet of sky, are living as the Word of God did not
intend them to live; they may have—they often have—great
spiritual compensations; they certainly have some spiritual
disadvantage in these unnatural negations. As long as
we have eyes and ears and the faculties of wonder and
admiration, so long must we suppose that the revelation
of the Word of God through Jesus of Nazareth has not
dispensed with the revelation of the Word of God through
the forces of material nature. If we wish to approach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>God we should not despise the Mediation of the Word of
God in its entirety, that is to say, the mediation of “the
World with Christ.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Now what practical inferences follow from our definition
of worship, if we are satisfied that it is roughly true?
Here let me put in a caution. Our definition cannot be
exactly true; for, in its exactness, worship means the sum
total of all the feelings that should be felt by the mind of
man, when he contemplates God through the mediation
of “the World with Christ.” Who can enumerate
these without confessing that he may have passed over
some so subtle and so deep that language itself has left
them unnamed? We must therefore be content with a
rough definition. But if it be roughly true that worship
means love, trust and awe, what practical inferences may
we thence deduce as regards our own conduct?</p>

<p class='c006'>First, then, worship is not the formal thing it is generally
supposed to be. It is not a mere smoothness of the
hinges of the knees, or a readiness to take the name of
God within one’s lips. It is a natural going forth of the
heart to that which one loves, trusts, and reverences most.
Some men have little power of reverencing; others, of
trusting; others, of loving; such men’s worship must
necessarily be maimed and imperfect. If a man who is
destitute of reverence loves and trusts money more than
anything else, money really is that man’s God; it is no
hyperbole, it is the fact; the man does actually worship
money; he does not say prayers to it, does not go down
on his knees to it, but he loves it and trusts it more than
anything else; therefore, so far as he can worship anything,
he worships money. Similarly another man worships
pleasure; another, his children; another, power.
We are accustomed to apologize for such expressions
as if they were metaphors or exaggerations; but they
are not; they are plain statements of spiritual realities.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Thousands of men who say they worship Christ, and who
honestly suppose they worship Christ, do nothing of the
kind. This is the dark side of the self-delusion of worship,
but there is a brighter. There are many men at
the present day who call themselves agnostics, but who
would hardly deny that they love and reverence Jesus of
Nazareth more than any other being. They worship Him
then. Their worship is tinged with hopelessness, and
therefore imperfect; but so far as it goes, it is a genuine
worship of Christ. Perhaps, too, some who profess
mere Theism feel, in their hearts, that though they
dislike to say they worship Christ, they love Christ more
than they love their conception of “God without Christ;”
if so, may we not say that, so far as that element of love
goes, they worship Christ? Thousands of thousands of
people, before Christ was born, worshipped Goodness
and a good God in their lives and hearts, though they
were, in name, worshippers of Apollo or Moloch. Thousands
of people in the same unconscious way have been,
and still are, worshipping the Incarnate Christ. They
may not acknowledge this, they may not even know it:
but their hearts have gone out to Him in love and trust
and awe, more than to any other person or thing in
heaven or earth.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Search your own soul and acknowledge how little you
know of God; I do not mean how little you profess to
know, but how little you really know; how very much of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>what you think you know, is but second-hand knowledge,
scraps of sayings repeated on authority, but not representing
any heartfelt faith. Then—after deducting all
the verbiage that you once esteemed a part of your own
belief—take the poor residuum of your conception of the
Godhead, and put it by the side of your conception of the
Word of God incarnate in Christ, making some faint
attempt at the same time to realize the stupendous life and
character of Jesus. Then ask yourself in what respects
the former conception differs from the latter for the better.
Lastly ask yourself what you mean by worship—not lip-worship,
or knee-worship, but the worship of the heart;
and whether your heart does not go out in heart-worship
as much towards the latter as to the former of these two
conceptions. If you will do this fairly and honestly, my
only fear would be that you might find that your conception
of God Himself was too weak to retain its grasp on
you; but if God still held His place in your heart, then I
should feel confident that Christ would sit enthroned by
His side, as being the Son without whom the Father
could not be known, worshipped in virtue of a claim
which no mere performance of miracles could establish,
and which no mere non-performance of miracles
could invalidate.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sum is this. In Nature there is evil as well as
good. I cannot therefore worship the Author of <i>all</i> Nature,
but must worship the Author of <i>Nature-minus the evil</i>.
Where is He to be found? He is revealed in what we
recognize to be good, true, and beautiful. Now no one
man can include in his life all that we mean by scientific
truth, and artistic beauty, as well as moral goodness.
But, truth being a harmony, there is no deeper and nobler
truth than the harmony of a human will with the will of
the Supreme; and, beneath perishable artistic beauty,
there is an eternal beauty to be discerned in righteousness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>It ought not therefore to surprise us that the
Eternal Word, after endeavouring for thousands of years
to lead creation up from the worship of Power to the
worship of Goodness, should at last take upon Himself
the form of a creature, conspicuously powerless from the
world’s point of view, ignorant of science, and destitute
of outward beauty, but of a goodness so divinely beautiful
and so true to the Underlying Laws of spiritual Nature,
that when He held out His arms and called upon wandering
mankind to come to Him, the enlightened conscience of
humanity sought refuge in His embrace.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>
  <h2 id='let12' class='c004'>XII <br /> THE WORSHIP OF CHRIST</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>Your letter of yesterday raises two objections,
which I will do my best to meet. First, if I regard
Christ as God, I ought not, you think, to stumble at
the miracles, but to welcome, and even to require, them;
and secondly, you are not satisfied with my definition
of worship. Let me deal first with your first objection,
restating it in your own words.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I admit,” you say, “that Jesus, even without miracles,
would be worthy of worship in your sense of the word;
but that is not the same thing as regarding Him as the
Eternal Son of God, the Creative Word. I agree with
Plato that there is nothing more like God than the man
who is as just as man may be; but you demand more of
me than this; you wish me to regard Him not as being
merely ‘<i>like</i> God’ but as ‘<i>being</i> God,’ ‘very God of very
God.’ Surely you must therefore admit that Jesus was
exceptional, and not ‘in the course of nature;’ and the
introduction into the visible world of such an exceptional
and supernatural Being surely makes it antecedently
probable, if not necessary, that He would bring with Him
some quite exceptional phenomena in the way of evidence.
The Miraculous Conception and Resurrection of Christ’s
Body (if only they were true) would supply just the
requisite evidence that Jesus was the Creative Word,
Lord over the issues of life and death. If the creative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Power of God, no less than the Righteousness and the
Love of God, was incarnate in the person of Jesus, it would
have been no less manifest in His life and works. But
you desire to reduce Him to a being in no way distinguishable
from other men except by superior moral
excellence. There is, it seems to me, no logical connection
between moral excellence and creative power. The
two attributes, being generically different, demand different
kinds of evidence to substantiate them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Again,” you continue, “even if I put aside your
contention that Jesus is the Word of God, there remains
your assertion that He is sinless. Now a sinless Jesus is,
in Himself, a miracle; and if you call on me to believe
that Jesus was without sin, you ought to see no antecedent
improbability, nay, you ought to see an antecedent
probability, that He would work miracles.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Well, I feel that we are walking in a slippery region—this
land of antecedent metaphysical probabilities; but I
will try to follow you. Let me take your second objection
first. Does it then really seem to you no less antecedently
probable that the Word of God, made man, should have
the power (say) of walking on water, than that He should
be sinless? Surely we see in the best men approximations
to sinlessness, but no approximations at all to what
spiritualists (I believe) call “levitation”! In proportion
as men approximate to our conception of God, in that proportion
they are free from sin, but they do not “levitate;”
hence, while we are led to believe that the Man who
completely represents God (the Word of God Incarnate)
will be absolutely sinless, we are led to no such conclusion
as to “levitation.” Or will you maintain that the best
men shew any germ of any the least power to suspend
any the least law of nature? There is no vestige of
any such tendency around us; and your only support for
such a belief would be found in the miracles of the Old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Testament, which you yourself deny, and as to which I
shall have something to say in a future letter.</p>

<p class='c006'>I admit however that there is one seeming argument
derived from the “mighty works” of healing undoubtedly
worked by the disciples of Jesus as well as by Jesus Himself.
Without anticipating a subject that must be deferred
to a future letter, I will merely ask you at this stage to
distinguish between those “mighty works” on the one
hand which were marvellous but not miraculous, and the
“miracles” on the other hand which, if true, involved
suspensions of the laws of nature. That Jesus may
have healed certain diseases through faith, would be
acknowledged by the most sceptical physiologists as
quite possible in accordance with the laws of nature;
and this power would be consistent with such a faith-inspiring
personality as we attribute to our Lord. Even
from ordinary men and women there “goes out virtue,”
we scarcely know how, to the sick and suffering who are
imbued with their hopefulness, their cheerfulness, their
faith; much more might we suppose that from the Ideal
of Humanity “virtue” would probably go forth in unique
measure and produce unique results, though always in
accordance with those laws of material nature to which
He had submitted Himself. But this is no argument for
real “miracles”; and—even while arguing—I protest
against this method of arguing about facts, from metaphysical
“antecedent probability.” I do not object to
the argument from “antecedent probability” where you
can appeal to experience and argue from what happened
in the past to what is likely to happen in the future.
But where you can have no such evidence (because the
Son of God was not twice incarnate); where the question
is, “Did Jesus do this or did He not?” and where we
have history and evidence to guide us, as to what He
did and said; it seems to me we ought to be guided by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>evidence and not by “antecedent probabilities,” especially
when these “probabilities” are derived from nothing but
metaphysical considerations.</p>

<p class='c006'>But you tell me that you see “no logical connection
between moral excellence and creative power;” and
another passage in your letter says that “we have no
reason for thinking that the best men shew any tendency
to approximate, in creative power, to the co-eternal Word.”
What do you thence infer? Apparently this, that, as
Christ revealed God’s righteousness and love by His own
righteousness and love, so He must have revealed God’s
creative power by His own creative acts. I, too, believe
that. But by what creative acts? By changing water
into wine, or seven loaves into seven thousand loaves, or
three fishes into three thousand fishes? Think of it
seriously. Do these two or three abrupt and dislocated
achievements appear to you adequately to represent the
quiet, gradual, orderly, creative power of the true Word
of God, by whom the heavens were made? For my part
I see a noble meaning in your words, but the meaning I
see in them is not what you mean. It was necessary—so
far I agree with you—that the Incarnate Word should
manifest God’s creative Power as well as His Love and
Righteousness. But how? Can you not answer for yourself
without my prompting? Does not your own conscience
suggest to you what is the highest effort of creative
power? Are we not taught—and do not our hearts
respond to the teaching—that God is a Spirit? And, if
God is a Spirit, must not the highest kind of creation
be, not material, but spiritual?</p>

<p class='c006'>Now I maintain that it is a greater, more sublime,
and more God-like act to create righteousness in accordance
with God’s spiritual laws than to create loaves and
fishes and wine against God’s material laws. And I
maintain also—in opposition to your opinion—that “the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>best men” <i>do</i> manifest “a tendency to approximate in
creative power to the co-eternal Word,” so far as concerns
this, the highest kind of creation. It is hard, very
hard, for us to realize—in spite of the teaching of the
prophets in old times and of the great English poets in
our own days—that the creation of the heaven and the
earth is “a very little thing, a drop of a bucket,” as compared
with the creation of righteousness. It is a desperate
struggle, this battle of the spirit against matter, of the invisible
against the visible, before we can believe, with all
our being—with our minds as well as our hearts—that the
creation described in the first chapter of the Fourth
Gospel was more divine than that described in the first
chapter of the Book of Genesis. But it was so. The
first creation of orderly matter was but a shadowy, unsubstantial
metaphor, predicting the second creation of
orderly spirit. “All things were made by him, and without
him was not anything made that was made:” so
writes the Evangelist, describing the first, and proceeding
to describe the second, creation: and he continues thus,
“In him was life, and the life was the light of men.” To
the same effect writes St. Paul: “The first Adam became
a living soul. The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.”
Is it not possible, on the testimony of one’s own conscience,
and on the testimony of history present and past,
and on the testimony of the Apostles and Evangelists—even
when critically reviewed and disencumbered of the
miraculous element—to acknowledge that Jesus has been
indeed “a life-giving Spirit” to mankind, and to worship
Him as representing the Creative Word who has
moved on the face of the material and of the spiritual
waters, creating order alike in the matter of the Universe
and in the minds and consciences of men?</p>

<p class='c006'>And now to deal with your second objection (directed
against my definition of worship) which I will repeat in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>your own words:—“You define worship as consisting of
the sentiments of love, trust, and awe. I confess this
does not express <i>all</i> my notion of worship. Such sentiments
I have felt towards my teachers, whether dead or
living, but I do not consider that I worship them. When
we apply the word to God, we mean by it a direct act of
communion—or at least a real effort after communion—
between two minds. When I pray to God, I believe myself
to be directing my thoughts towards a Being with
whom I am spiritually in direct and immediate relation—the
Maker of all, <i>my</i> Maker and Father. But I cannot
persuade myself that I stand in a like relation to Jesus of
Nazareth. We do not pray to Paul or Plato, and I do
not see any such difference in the historical manifestations
of Jesus as should lead me to believe that I, and millions
of other believers, can make my thoughts known to him,
and can receive back impressions from him, when we
cannot do so to other minds which have helped to change
the world’s history and have been revealers of the
Father.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Are you not here confusing a state of mind with an
action resulting from that state of mind? We have been
speaking, not of lip-worship, but of heart-worship, defining
it as a state of mind. Now is not prayer the result
of worship, rather than identical with worship, as we have
defined it above? A child feels love, and trust, as well as
reverence, for its parents; and, in consequence he asks
them to grant his desires, or he thanks them for kindnesses;
but yet the asking and thanking are not identical with the
feelings of the children towards their parents, but spring
from those feelings. Similarly we, feeling a trust and an
awe for the Maker and Father, far beyond what we can
feel for Paul or Plato, impart to Him our petitions for our
highest needs, or offer Him our thanks: but this asking
and this thanking are not identical with, but the results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>of, the feelings we entertain towards God. What you really
mean is that your love, trust, and awe towards God so far
transcend those corresponding feelings when entertained
by you for your fellow-creatures, that you ask from Him
things which you would never dream of asking from them.
Moreover you consider (rightly or wrongly) that a dead
or absent man cannot enter into communion with you,
but that God is superior to death and to the limitations
of space, and that He alone can always hear and always
answer; and this you appear to think a non-miraculous
Christ cannot do.</p>

<p class='c006'>Well, here I confess there is a vast difference between
us; for I feel sure that Christ can do this. You say, I
do not “pray to Paul and Plato:” I do not, though I
sometimes think that it would be better to pray to Paul
or Plato than to the sun or moon. But I do not find
Paul, I do not find Plato, claiming power to forgive sins;
or declaring that he came to die for mankind and that
his blood was to be shed for the remission of sins; or
predicting that he should be slain and that he should rise
from the dead; or promising that whatsoever his disciples
asked from the Father in his name should be performed;
or promising to give his disciples, after his death, a spirit,
the Holy Spirit of the Father, which should enable them
to resist all adversaries after he had left them; or, in other
words, making a manifest preparation to prepare his
disciples for his death on the ground that after death he
would still be present with them and still their guide and
helper. Now even when I set aside the Fourth Gospel,
and eliminate all miraculous narrative from the first three
Gospels, I find myself in the presence of One who, I am
convinced, both said these things, and made them good
in deeds. I am penetrated with the conviction that He
said them and had a right to say them; and that this is
proved by literary and historical evidence, and by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>history of the Church, and by my own experience. The
miracles I can easily disentangle from the life of Christ;
but His divine claims to be our Helper and Saviour after
death and to all eternity, I cannot. Accepting them, I
can neither deny Him worship nor myself the right of
access to Him in prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>Christ’s whole life and doctrine, His plan (so to speak) for
the establishment of spiritual empire over the hearts of
men, appear to me imbued with divinity; but if I were
forced to choose some one particular discourse or incident
in His life as a reason for my adoration of Him, I should
not choose any of His mighty works of healing, nor any
of His parables or discourses, nor even His death upon
the cross: I should point to the institution of the Lord’s
Supper. As the years pass over my head, the picture
of that mysterious evening becomes more and more
powerful and vivid with me and more and more inexplicable
unless Jesus was verily the Life of the world. It is
ten times more vivid and more powerful now than it was
when I believed in a miraculous Jesus. When I kneel
down at the altar-rails there rises up through the distance
of eighteen centuries that strange scene in the guest-chamber
at Jerusalem, where Jesus portioned out His
flesh and blood, bequeathing Himself to His disciples
for ever. Then follows the thought of the countless
myriads of souls who have derived spiritual strength from
this rite and have lived again in Christ, and I say to
myself, “Truly God was in the self-doomed man who thus
gave us His flesh and blood for mankind. A mere man
devise so strange a rite! So (at first) repellently strange!
so profoundly simple! so perfectly and spiritually successful!”
I solemnly protest to you that the inexpressible
depth of the divine intuition which found utterance in the
Lord’s Supper, impresses me more and more—far more
than all the miracles put together—as a proof that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>have in Christ a Being in initial and fundamental harmony
with the very source of our spiritual life; and, rationalist
though I am, I find myself, nevertheless, praying naturally
and spontaneously after this fashion: “Master, my
only true Lord and Master, grant that I may feed on thy
body and be quickened by thy blood, and live in thee
a new and spiritual life! Thou One Forgiver of sins,
thou Bearer of all the burdens of mankind, bear Thou the
burden that I cannot bear, and blot out all my offences;
Thou who sittest at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
lift me in thyself even to the throne of heaven, and
present me to the Father as His child! Thou who didst
die in the flesh and rise again in the spirit never to die,
rise thou in my heart and soul; take my whole being into
thyself and cause Me there to die unto sin and to live with
thee unto righteousness! Grant me eternal life, thou Lord
of Life! Say within my soul, ‘Let there be righteousness,’
and there shall be righteousness! Create me anew, O
Lord, thou ever-living, co-eternal Word of the Creator.”</p>

<p class='c006'>You may object that many of these prayers, with slightly
different wording, might equally well be addressed to the
Father through the Son. They might, and, as a rule, they
probably would be so addressed. But in moments of unusually
deep emotion prayers of this kind go forth I
think, more naturally to the Father in the Son than to the
Father through the Son; and surely your very objection,
and my answer to it, shewing that prayers may be indifferently
addressed to the Father or to the Son, constitute a
strong argument for the unity (in the heart of the person
praying) of Son and Father. And if I can pray like this, do
I not worship, must I not worship, Christ as the Creative
Word, the Eternal Son of God? And is there anything
to prevent me from praying like this in the fact that He to
whom I pray, when He received our humanity, received it
in truth and honesty, with all its material limitations?</p>

  <h2 id='let13' class='c004'>XIII <br /> WHAT IS NATURE?</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>Desiring to approach the subject of miracles, you
ask me whether I do not accept the following sentence as
a statement of my views concerning nature: “The
Universe is perennially renewed and created afresh by
an active energy of the Spirit of God, and what we call
‘laws of nature’ are the mode in which our limited minds
are enabled to apprehend the working of Creative Power.”
If I accept it, you declare you cannot understand why I
should stumble at miracles. “It is a matter of every-day
experience,” you say, “and natural, that the human will
should suspend the laws of nature, as for example by
arresting the motion of gravitation; and consequently it
seems unreasonable for you, or for other believers in a
personal God, to be scandalized if He also now and then
permits Himself the same liberty.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I accept your statement, so far as concerns the perennial
energy of the Spirit of God upon the material and immaterial
Universe; but I do not quite agree with the
thought, or perhaps I should say with the expression, of
the last part of your sentence—“the mode in which our
limited minds are enabled to apprehend the working of
Creative Power.” I should prefer to call the Laws of
Nature “a revelation of Himself by God to men, on the
recognition of which our very existence depends.” The
Laws of Nature are indeed nothing but ideas of our own
Imagination; but they appear to me, more or less, true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>ideas, through which God has revealed Himself to us as a
God of Law and Order. I believe in the fixity of natural
Law as much (I think) as the man of science does; I
reverence a Law of Nature, not as a result of necessity,
but as an expression of God’s will. But your own remarks
about the ordinary “suspension of the law of nature by
the human will” appear to me to imply a little confusion
of thought arising from a confused use of the word
“nature” in two or more senses. On this point therefore
I should like to say a few words.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>Nature</h3>
<p class='c005'>i. <i>Nature sometimes means the ordinary course of
things apart from us and from our intervention</i>; as
when we say that “<i>Nature</i> looks gay”—an expression
which we might use of fields and even of a not too
artificial garden, but not of a city or a street.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this sense it may be occasionally applied to the
ordinary course of things in our own bodily frame, so far
as it goes on without our deliberate intervention; as when
a physician tells a fussy patient to cease from medicining
himself and to “let <i>Nature</i> take its course.”</p>

<p class='c006'>ii. <i>Nature sometimes means the ordinary course of
things in ourselves, not in our bodies but in some other
part of us, but still apart from our deliberate intervention</i>;
as when we say that “<i>Nature</i> impels us to avoid pain, to
preserve our lives, to cherish our children, to love and
revere our parents, and to seek the esteem and friendship
of our neighbours.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But sometimes in human beings one “natural” impulse
is opposed by another: as when the desire to preserve
one’s life is opposed by the desire to gain the esteem of
one’s neighbours. When these two conflict, which is to
be called the more “natural”?</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>The answer will be different, according as we use the
word “natural” in the sense of “ordinary” or “orderly.”
One class of natural impulses, which may be called selfish
or self-regarding, is perhaps more <i>ordinarily</i> predominant;
another class, those which regard the good of
others, contributes more to the progress and <i>order</i> of
society. In the individual, as well as in society, the
former or “ordinary” impulses, if unchecked, often tend
to excess of passion, and what we call mental “disorder”;
the latter (which are seldom in excess) tend to self-control
and a well-ordered mind. In the former sense, it is more
“natural,” because more  “ordinary,” to laugh when we
are tickled, or to seize food when we are hungry, than to
die for our country or to provide food for our children;
but, in the latter sense, the nobler actions are more
“natural” because more in accordance with order.</p>

<p class='c006'>What do we mean by a well-ordered mind? We mean
one in which the Will does not at once yield to the
impulses from the things which seem nearest to ourselves;
in which the Imagination vividly presents to us the wants
of our neighbours as well as our own; in which the
Reason states what can be said for and against each
proposal, and the Conscience finally decides the course
to be taken. Here then we see an entirely new notion of
Nature, at least so far as man is concerned; a course or
order of things no longer apart from human intervention,
but entirely dependent upon the supremacy of the Will
and Conscience aided by Reason and Imagination: and
hence we are led to a double definition of human Nature
as follows:—</p>

<p class='c006'>iii. <i>Human Nature means, sometimes the ordinary,
sometimes the orderly, course of human things.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Even as to non-human Nature we sometimes find a
popular tendency to call, or think “unnatural,” some
phenomena which strike us as being contrary to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>general order and beneficence of things: and hence we
are less fond of saying that Nature prompts the cat to
torture the mouse or the moth to fly into the flame, than
that she implants in the animal race the parental instinct
to protect the young. I confess I sympathize with this
tendency, and with all those who in their hearts look
upon death and pain as being contrary to the ideal order
of things and ultimately destined to be destroyed. But
for the present, apart from sentiment, let us simply note
the fact that in our popular language we sometimes say
that it is the nature of a clock to indicate the right time,
but sometimes that it is its nature to deviate from the
right time: whence we deduce the conclusion that:—</p>

<p class='c006'>iv. <i>The Nature of a thing means sometimes its object,
sometimes its custom.</i></p>
<h3 class='c013'>Laws of Nature</h3>
<p class='c005'>Many of those unbroken sequences of phenomena
around us, which have been most frequently observed,
have been made the subject of the Imagination and have
received an imaginative name. When we find Nature,
upon an invariable system, dealing out rewards for one
course of action and penalties for another, there is
suggested to us the thought of a great Lawgiver laying
down laws and affixing rewards for obeying, and penalties
for disobeying. Hence the sequences of natural phenomena
have been called “Laws of Nature.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Every action of every moment of our lives is performed
for the most part in the instinctive and unconscious
confidence that Nature will not deceive us by breaking
her Laws: and hence they might, from another point of
view, be called “Promises of Nature,” or “Expressions
of the Will of Nature;” but “Law of Nature” has been
selected—not perhaps altogether happily—as suggesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>something more fixed and definite than even the Promises
or Will of the Maker of the world.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Law of Nature is a metaphorical name for a frequently
observed sequence of phenomena (apart from human
Will), implying; to some minds, regularity; to others,
absolute invariability.</i></p>
<h3 class='c013'>Suspension of Laws of Nature</h3>
<p class='c005'>Does human Will ever suspend a Law of Nature?</p>

<p class='c006'>I am standing, we will suppose, under a tree in autumn.
If a leaf flutters down and rests upon my head, the Law
of gravitation is no more suspended by my Will, than if
it rests upon some intercepting bough. The result of the
Law is modified; downward motion is replaced by downward
pressure: but the Law itself is not suspended.</p>

<p class='c006'>But if, upon the command of a man, the leaf were
arrested in mid air and remained immovable for an hour
together, and if I were led to the conclusion that this was
effected by no force which I could conceive as being
consistent with the ordinary course of Nature and with
the limitations of human power, then I should be obliged
to say that the Law of gravitation, in this particular
instance, did not work. Using a metaphor, I might say
that the Law was “suspended,” and the phenomenon
itself I should call a miracle.</p>

<p class='c006'>In reality the true explanation might be quite different.
It is conceivable that an extraordinary man, once in a
thousand or once in ten thousand years, might be
endowed with the power of arresting the motion of a
stone in the air, without the intervention of the body and
by the mere exercise of Will; and this might be done by
him as easily, as regularly, and (for him) as naturally, as
we ordinary men stop a stone in the air by the exercise
of Will acting upon our bodily machinery. In that case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>gravitation would still act, pressing the stone, so to
speak, upon an invisible hand: and the explanation
would be, not that the Law was suspended, but that the
results of the Law were uniquely modified by the peculiar
action of a unique human nature, in the same way in
which they are commonly modified by the regular action
of an ordinary human nature. This, I say, is conceivable.
Yet if we find (1) in past history, a general tendency to
believe in miracles on very slight evidence; (2) in the
present time, a general and, as many think, a universal
refutation of the evidence on which miracles have been
accepted; (3) an increasing power of explaining many
so-called miracles in accordance with natural Laws—it
becomes our obvious duty to regard miraculous narratives
with a very strong suspicion until cogent evidence has
been produced for their truth.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>The Action of the Will</h3>
<p class='c005'>Hitherto we have been considering the action of the Will
upon external Nature; but now what as to the action of
our Will upon our own Nature, upon the machinery of
our own body? Is that to be called a Law of Nature or
a suspension of a Law of Nature?</p>

<p class='c006'>It is to be called neither. Our definition of “Law of
Nature” was “a metaphorical name given to the ordinary
course of things <i>apart from the intervention of human
will</i>:” consequently the action of human will (about
which we are now speaking) is expressly excluded from
the province of Nature, in this sense, and can neither be
called “a Law of Nature,” nor a “suspension of a Law of
Nature.” The action of the Will falls under the head of
“human Nature;” and, discussing it under that head, we
may call it by any metaphor we please, a custom, habit,
law of human Nature.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>This distinction between the name given to the course
of non-human Nature and the name given to the action
of the human Will on the bodily framework, is based
on our distinction between the regular and (if I may
use the word) the anticipable sequences of the former,
as contrasted with the irregular and unanticipable sequences
of the latter. When the Will is undeveloped or
enfeebled; when the human being is a baby, or one of
an excited and undisciplined crowd, or mad, or drunk, or
narcoticized, or mesmerized, or reduced to the bestial
level by some overpowering instinct; we can occasionally
prophesy his actions or movements with something of the
certainty and accuracy with which we predict the motions
of a machine; but we cannot thus calculate the actions
of a mature, healthy, and reasonable man. Hence it has
been usual to contrast with the “Laws of Nature” the
“freedom of the human Will.” We cannot demonstrate
the freedom of the Will any more than the fixity of the
Laws of Nature: the belief in both is suggested by
Imagination, tested and approved by Experience and
Reason, and finally retained by Faith. Of course, when I
speak thus, you will not suppose that I assume that my
mind, or being, is divided into distinct parts (as the body
consists of distinct limbs) called Will, Reason, &amp;c.: you
will understand that I merely use the ordinary brief and
convenient phraseology which says “The Will does so-and-so,”
meaning “I do so-and-so with a certain consciousness
which appears to me to result from a faculty
inherent in me of choosing between two or more courses
of action, which faculty I call Will.” With this precaution,
I assert that the action of the Will is natural as regards
human Nature, but outside Nature or  “extra-natural” as
regards non-human Nature, and that it does not involve
the suspension of what are technically called “the Laws
of Nature.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>It is thus shown that the human Will acts directly on
the human body in accordance with the Laws of human
Nature, and that it does not interfere with the external
world except indirectly, through the body, in accordance
with the Laws of Nature (as technically defined). There
is nothing therefore in the action of the human Will
that would justify the <i>a priori</i> inference that the divine
Will would, <i>by any direct intervention</i>, disturb or suspend
that fixed Order in the external world which constitutes
a large part of the revelation of God to mankind.</p>

<p class='c006'>If indeed we are to draw any kind of parallel between
divine and human action, we shall have to ask ourselves
what is there appertaining to the divine Spirit which can
in any sense be said to correspond to its “Body”? And
I suppose we shall reply, in Pauline language, that Mankind,
which is said to have Christ for its Head, might be
mystically and spiritually called the Body of the divine
Will or Holy Spirit. If this be so, proceeding with our
parallel, might we not repeat, word for word, with the
needful proportionate changes, the language of the last
paragraph: “The divine Will or Spirit acts directly on
the divine body (that is on mankind) in accordance with
the Laws of Spiritual Nature, and it does not interfere
with the external world, except indirectly, through mankind,
in accordance with the Laws of Nature (as technically
defined)”? I do not say that this analogy is logic-proof:
for what can be called a “body,” or what “external,” in
relation to the all-pervading God? Nevertheless, as it
falls in with our actual experiences, this mystical parallel
seems as well worth recording as most <i>a priori</i> notions on
this subject, though we take it as no more than an illustration
of possibilities. But, if we are to confine ourselves
to certainties, the one thing certain is, that Nature, in
the fullest sense, human as well as non-human, emphatically
discourages us from expecting “miracles.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>
  <h2 id='let14' class='c004'>XIV <br /> THE MIRACLES OF THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>Your last letter now comes to the point which I
have been long anticipating, or rather it recurs to the
point from which our correspondence started—the credibility
of the miracles attributed to Christ. You tell me
that during the long vacation you have been rapidly
reviewing my letters and attempting to enter into my
views. There is much, you say, that is new, and there is
something that improves on acquaintance, in this form of
“Christian Positivism” as you call it; its intellectual
security has attractions for you, and it seems to you to
satisfy at once the aspirations of those who are drawn to
worship humanity, and of those who are drawn to worship
something above humanity. All this looks very well on
paper, you say; but when you take up the Gospels, it
seems to fade away into a mere student’s dream: and
you state the objection thus: “For our knowledge of
Christ, we depend almost entirely upon the New Testament;
now the New Testament contains accounts of
miracles; these miracles we are unable to accept as
historical; consequently the New Testament must be
regarded as non-historical, and the whole story of Christ
becomes a myth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In return for this argument about the New Testament
let me supply you with a similarly sceptical one about the
Old Testament, and ask you whether you are prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>consistently to adopt it. “For our knowledge of the
children of Israel, we depend almost entirely upon the Old
Testament; now the Old Testament contains accounts
of miracles; these miracles we are unable to accept
as historical; consequently the Old Testament must be
regarded as non-historical, and the story of the descendants
of Israel becomes a myth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Now are you really satisfied with this argument? The
so-called Law of Moses, the wandering in the Wilderness,
the conquest of Canaan, the lives of the wonder-working
Gideon and of Barak, the wars and songs of David, the
denunciations, warnings, consolations, sorrows, visions, of
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the other prophets, are
they indeed, in your judgment, converted into mere myths
by the admixture of the miraculous element? Are they
even made so far mythical as not to reveal the story of
the training of one of the most remarkable of nations, a
nation theologically quite singular upon earth? I contend
on the contrary, that the removal of the miraculous
element results in a two-fold advantage, on the one hand
placing the story of Israel in the province of history, and
on the other hand, not bringing it down to the level of
the common-place, but elevating it to a pinnacle among
the histories of nations, and making it in a certain sense
more wonderful than before. If Moses was a plenipotentiary
miracle-worker from God, then there was nothing
unexpected or wonderful in the spiritual results that he
achieved; and the wonder rather is that he achieved so
little. Give me the thunders of Sinai, with power to burn,
blast, and plague my opponents; add to these the power of
producing without labour and without delay miraculous
supplies of manna, quails, and water, and I myself would
undertake to terrify or allure any nation into obeying a far
less noble and attractive code of laws than was set forth
in the name of Moses. But when I see a lawgiver with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>no such powers, doing what Moses did, and shaping, or
preparing the way for shaping, one of the most carnal
and unspiritual of races into a nation of Priests and
Prophets for the civilised world, then I am ready to fall
upon my face and to take my shoes from off my feet,
saying from the depth of my heart, “Truly God is in this
place.” “But,” say you, “the so-called Law of Moses is
no more due to Moses than trial by jury is due to Alfred.”
That matters not. It is not any one Israelite; it is Israel
as a whole, Israel and its lawgivers and poets and prophets
collectively; it is the evolution of the spiritual from the
carnal Israel that I revere; and all the more, if that
evolution be natural. Regarded as miraculous, the history
of Israel is somewhat of a failure and a bathos; but,
regarded as non-miraculous, it becomes a most miraculous
triumph of divine intention and persistence, even
though the walls of Jericho succumbed to the trumpets of
Israel only in hyperbole, and although the sun stood still
at the bidding of Joshua only in the impassioned language
of an Oriental poet.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am quite sure you must feel this as strongly as I do;
you cannot honestly and sincerely put aside all the history
of Israel as a myth because it contains a non-historic
element of miracles, any more than you put aside the
battles of Salamis and Regillus because they too have
received their miraculous adornment. But some are
probably perplexed and scandalized at the task that is
apparently set before them of disentangling the true from
the false, the myth from the non-myth: “How strange,”
they say, “that the story of the training of the Priests of
the world, that story which should have been a light to
guide our feet, has been suffered to shed darkness instead
of light and falsehood instead of truth! Is it probable,
is it even decent and reverent, to suppose that God should
have allowed the Book of Revelation to be so falsified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>that the simple and unlearned cannot depend upon it
without the aid of scholars and specialists?”</p>

<p class='c006'>My reply is that, as long as men reason in this way,
assuming that Revelation ought to have been conveyed
by some perfect medium, and therefore that it must have
been conveyed by some perfect medium, so long it will
be as impossible to refute them as it was to refute the
Aristotelian astronomers who argued that “The planets
ought to move in perfect curves; and the circle is a
perfect curve; and therefore the planets must move in
circles.” We are like children crying for the moon if we
demand that this world, or that anything in this world,
shall be arranged as if the world were the best of all
possible worlds. It is not the best possible world, and
we know it is not. Some things attest the glory
of God more perfectly than others; but nothing attests
it quite perfectly. You might as well hope to remove
refraction from the atmosphere, as to remove from the
human mind the prejudices which compel and always
have compelled mankind to exaggerate and misrepresent
divine truth by forcing us to think that God must have
acted as we should have acted had we been in His place.</p>

<p class='c006'>If you and I were omnipotent and had to re-make the
Universe, I suppose there is no question but we should
make man perfectly good (according to our notions of
goodness) and that we should force him to remain good.
And if you or I were omnipotent and had to reveal anything
to men, we should write it large and clear in the sky,
or in the heart, legible to all without effort, so that men
should be forced to understand it. But God has neither
done this nor anything like it. Therefore, since in other
respects He has departed so very far from our notions of
the best method, we cannot be surprised if He has not
composed the Old Testament quite in the manner which
would commend itself to us as the best. From our point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>of view the Bible teems with obvious imperfections. In
the first place there are none of the modern arrangements
for securing accuracy. No special newspaper reporters,
not even contemporary writers of memoirs or histories,
have handed down to posterity the exact words and deeds
of Moses, David, Isaiah, and the great heroes and prophets
of Israel. Might we not almost say that there have been
as it were arrangements for securing inaccuracy? The
authors wrote, in many cases, long after the events they
recorded, under conditions which rendered accuracy
of detail quite impossible. They have often been lengthy
where we could have desired brevity (as for example in
the enumerations of pedigrees and in the details of the
furniture and ritual of the Temple or the Tabernacle) and
very brief where we should have prized amplitude. Writing
as Orientals for the most part write history, without
statistical exactness, they have sometimes made mistakes
(sometimes self-contradictory mistakes) in numbers and
names, which it is now impossible to rectify. Nay, we
can hardly acquit them sometimes of moral error; they
have at all events sometimes appeared to praise, or at
least not to blame, sometimes even to impute to God, acts
that would seem to us—even when all due allowance is
made for difference between ancient and modern standards
of morality—deserving of express and severe censure.</p>

<p class='c006'>But their special error which we are now considering
remains yet unmentioned. You know that nations, like
individuals, in their infancy have very vague notions of
the uniformity of Nature, and very strong notions of the
personality of Nature or of some Beings behind Nature.
Even in modern times Orientals would say that God or
Allah did this or that, where we say that this or that
“happened;” and I remember hearing not many years
ago that some Jews of Palestine, suffering from the consequences
of extensive conflagration, wrote to England for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>relief in a letter which declared—in perfect good faith, and
without any intention to imply a miracle—that God had
“sent down fire from heaven upon their town.” An
Eastern traveller of modern times tells an amusing story
to the same effect how a camel-driver, when questioned as
to the cause of his rheumatism, could not be induced for
a long time to make any other answer except that “Allah
had caused it;” and even when the traveller had elicited
the immediate cause, the man would still persist that
“Allah had sent the rheumatism, though it had followed
upon drinking a great quantity of camels’ milk when he
was in a violent heat.” You should therefore accustom
yourself, if you want to understand the Bible, to look at
Western narrative from an Oriental point of view. Take
for example the interesting account given by the African
traveller Mungo Park of the manner in which a trifling
incident saved his life in the desert. Alone and desperate,
faint and famished, he had thrown himself down to die,
when he suddenly caught sight of a small but exquisitely
shaped plant of great rarity and interest: “And can God
have taken so much thought and care for the creation of
this little plant,” he cried, “and have no thought or care
for me?” In the strength of this suggestion he started up,
pressed on his way, and reached safety. Now compare
this striking little story with the similar incident of the
gourd, recorded in the Book of Jonah, and imagine how a
prophet of Israel could have described the message of
salvation. He would have told us (as the prophet Jonah
tells us) how the Lord God in the same day caused a
plant to grow up before the face of the man, and how the
Lord God said unto the man “Hath the Lord thy God
taken thought for this plant, and shall He take no thought
for thee? Arise, go on thy way”—giving, as from God,
the actual words of the thought which the Western
traveller describes as suggesting itself or occurring to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>mind. You must surely see how naturally this conversion
of the natural into the seemingly miraculous would have
been effected by a penman of Israel, without the least
intention to imply a real suspension of the laws of nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Keeping yourself still in the position of an Oriental
historian, consider what you would be called on to describe,
in setting down the story of Israel. You would find,
as your materials, various traditions, mostly oral, mostly
perhaps poetic, describing a great deliverance wrought in
every particular by the hand of Jehovah Himself: you
would find the nation around you, and yourself among the
rest, believing that Jehovah Himself had drowned the
Egyptians in the Red Sea, that His terrible voice had given
the Law from Sinai, that He had been to wandering Israel
a cloud in the noontide to protect them from the sun, and
a light in the darkness to give them guidance, that He had
supplied them with food from Heaven and spread a table
for them in the wilderness, that He had Himself given
them water from Himself (the Rock of Israel!) to quench
their thirst. If the Jordan’s fords, unusually shallow, had
allowed the whole nation to pass across, as upon dry land,
you would be taught as a child to hear and sing, in hymns
that reiterated the national deliverance, that the Lord
Himself had done this: “The waters saw thee, O Lord,
the waters saw thee, and were afraid.” If, in the general
terror of the Canaanites, a strong city suffered itself to be
taken on the mere onset and war cry of the invaders as
easily as though it had been an unwalled hamlet, the
traditions would tell how the walls fell flat at the sound
of the trumpets of Joshua; if some sudden storm, accompanied
with hail and immediately followed by an inundation
of swollen streams, threw the chariots and horses of
the enemy into confusion and ensured their speedy rout; or
if, on another occasion, the sudden gloom of a storm had
been succeeded by a long evening of peculiar brightness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>and clearness facilitating the pursuit and destruction of
the foe, then you would hear that the “stars in their
courses” fought against Sisera, or that in the day of
Beth-horon the Lord Himself sent down hailstones upon
the enemy and stopped the sun at the prayer of Joshua:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The sun and moon stood still in their habitation;</div>
      <div class='line'>At the light of thine arrows as they went,</div>
      <div class='line'>At the shining of thy glittering spear.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>All these materials, expressed in terse poetic phrase,
you, as a historian, would have to amplify into prose. Is
it not easy to see how, in the process, without any fraud or
conscious exaggeration on your part, you would transmute
the natural into the miraculous?</p>

<p class='c006'>To go through the whole of the miracles in the Old
Testament and to attempt to shew how in almost every
case the miraculous part of the story may have crept in
without intention to deceive, would be a task far above
my powers; and it would require a book not a letter. If
you were to study with care the articles in the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i> on the books of the Old Testament they
would give you a good deal of light on this subject. But
the problem is complicated by the fact that the causes that
originated the miraculous element are not always the
same. For example the seven miracles of Elijah and the
fourteen miracles of Elisha (the latter number being
exactly the double of the former in order to fulfil the
prayer of Elisha for a “twofold” portion of the spirit of
his master) cannot be explained in the same way as the
miracles of the Wanderings or as those in the life of
Samson. The eminent Hebraist to whom we are indebted
for the Articles above-mentioned would confer on
all students of the Bible a very great benefit, if he would
give us a separate treatise on the Old Testament miracles.
Meantime I must content myself with shewing how some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>miracles, of what I may call a “grotesque” kind, may be
explained as the mere result of misunderstood names.
You must be familiar with this kind of explanation, I think,
in ancient history, and even in modern English history,
although you have never thought of applying it to the
Bible. Perhaps you have read in Mr. Isaac Taylor’s
<i>Words and Places</i> how the sexton in Leighton Buzzard
used to show the eagle of the lectern as the identical
<i>buzzard</i> from which the place derived its name—little
guessing that “Buzzard” is a mere corruption of “Beaudésert;”
and the porter at Warwick Castle, when he shows
you the bones of the “dun cow” slain by Guy of Warwick,
hands down a similar erroneous tradition probably derived
from a misunderstanding of “dun.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a> A far more famous
instance connects itself with the Phœnician name of
“Bosra,” belonging to the citadel of Carthage. This
name meant, in the Phœnician language, “citadel;” but
the Greeks confused it with the Greek word “Bursa,” a
“hide;” and then they proceeded to invent a story to explain
the name. Queen Dido, they said, had bought for
a small price as much ground as she could encompass
with a hide; she had cut the hide into thin thongs and
thereby purchased the site of a city for a trifle: hence the
city received the name of “Hide.” Thus subtilized the
Greeks; but it may interest you to know that our own
ancestors consciously or unconsciously followed in their
footsteps. There is near Sittingbourne a castle called Tong
or Thong Castle, situated on a “tongue” of land (Norse,
<i>tunga</i>) which has given it its name. But tradition has
invented or imitated the old Greek story, and has declared
that the castle was so-called because the site was
bought like Dido’s, a trifling price being given for so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>much land as could be included in the “thong” made
from a bull’s hide.</p>

<p class='c006'>But now to come to the particular instance which is
the only one I shall give from the Old Testament. You
must recollect, and I think you ought to have been
perplexed by, the astounding incident in the life of Samson,
connected with the “ass’s jawbone.” The hero is said
first to have slain some hundreds of men with the jawbone
of an ass, and then to have thrown away the jawbone
in the anguish of a parching thirst. Upon this, the
Lord is said, (in the Old Version of the Bible) to have
opened a fountain of water in the hollow of the jawbone
in answer to his cry: and the fountain was henceforth
named En-hakkore, <i>i.e.</i> the “fountain of him that calleth,”
because Samson “called upon the Lord.” Moreover,
when he cast away the jawbone, he is said to have called
the place Ramath-lehi; which the margin (not of the New
Version but of the Old) interprets, “the lifting up of the
jawbone” or “the casting away of the jawbone.” Without
pausing to dwell on the extreme improbability of the
details of the story, I will merely state the probable
explanation. It is probable that the valley containing
the “hollow” in which the fountain lay, was called, from
the configuration of the place, “the Ass’s Jawbone,”
before the occurrence of any exploit of Samson in it.
Indeed we find it actually called “Lehi,” or “Jawbone,”
in the narrative now under discussion, just before the
supposed incident of the jawbone took place: “The
Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
themselves in <i>Lehi</i> (<i>Jawbone</i>),” Judges xv. 9. This
latter fact indeed is not conclusive (as the narrator,
living long after the event, might possibly use the
name of the place handed down to him, even in writing
of a time when he believed the name to have been not
yet given): but the probability of a natural explanation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>the origin of the name receives strong confirmation from
a passage in Strabo (303) who actually mentions some
other place (I think in Peloponnesus) called the “Ass’s
Jawbone.” I need not say that Strabo narrates no such
Samsonian incident to explain the name, and that it was
probably derived (like Dogs Head, Hog’s Back and
many other such names) from some similarity between
the shape of an ass’s jawbone and the shape of the valley.
Moreover, the word translated “hollow,” though it might
represent the cavity in an ass’s jawbone, might also represent
the hollow in a valley, as in Zephaniah (i. 11) “Howl,
ye inhabitants of the <i>hollow</i>.” Again, the name Ramath-lehi
cannot mean “casting away of the jawbone;” it
means “lifting up,” or “<i>hill</i>,” of Lehi: and accordingly
the Revised Version translates, “that place was called
Ramath-lehi;” and the margin interprets the name thus,
“<i>The hill</i> of the jawbone”. I should add also that the
Revisers—instead of the Old Version, “clave an hollow
place <i>that was in the jaw</i>”—give us now, “clave the
hollow place that <i>is</i> in <i>Lehi</i>.” You must see now surely
how on every side the old miraculous interpretation
breaks down and makes way for a natural and non-miraculous
explanation of the legend. But we have still
to explain the name of the fountain, said to have been
given from the “calling” of Samson. This is easily done.
It appears that the phrase “him that calleth,” or “the
Caller,” is a Hebrew name for the Partridge, so named
from its “call,” or cry. The “Fountain of the Caller,”
therefore, in the “hollow place” of the “Ass’s Jawbone,”
was simply, as we might say, Partridge Well in Jawbone
Valley, which lay below Jawbone Hill.</p>

<p class='c006'>But now, many years after the champion of Israel had
passed away, comes the legendary poet or historian, who
has to tell of some great exploit of deliverance wrought
by the hero Samson in this Valley of the Jawbone of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Ass by the side of the Fountain of the Caller. Straight-way,
every local name must be connected with the
incident that fills his mind and the minds of all his
countrymen who live in the neighbourhood. And so
“Jawbone Valley” became so called because it was there
that Samson smote the Philistines with “the jawbone
of an ass;” and “Jawbone heights” are so-called
because on this spot Samson “lifted up” the jawbone
against his foes, or “threw it away” after he had destroyed
them; and “the Well of the Caller” derives not
only its name but even its miraculous existence from
“<i>the calling</i> of Samson upon Jehovah.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I think you will now perceive the kind of reasoning
which has compelled me to give up the miracles of the
Old Testament. It is not in any way because I have an
<i>a priori</i> prejudice against miracles: on the contrary,
I started with an <i>a priori</i> prejudice for miracles in the
Bible, though against miracles in general. It is not simply
because there is not sufficient evidence for them; it is
in great measure because there is evidence against them.
For, when you can shew how a supposed miracle may
naturally have occurred, and how the miraculous account
may naturally and easily have sprung up, I think that
amounts to evidence against the miracle. And of course
when you find yourself compelled to explain in this way
a large number of miracles in the Old Testament, it
becomes far more probable than before that the rest are
susceptible of some natural explanation. I do not pretend
to have investigated in detail every miraculous narrative
in the Old Testament. I am ready to admit that at the
bottom of the miraculous, there may have been in many
cases something very wonderful. Being for example
personally very much inclined to the mysterious, I would
not deny that in the Hebrew race, as in some others,
there may have been some strange power, natural but at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>present inexplicable, of “second sight;” but, on the
whole, looking at the evidence for and against the miracles
of the Old Testament, I have now no hesitation in rejecting
them as miracles, however much I may admire the spirit
that suggested the narratives, as exhibiting a profound
and spiritual sense of the sympathy of God with men.</p>

<p class='c006'>But we may perhaps be called upon to believe in the
miracles of the Old Testament on the authority, so to
speak, of the miracles of the New Testament. Such at
least I take to be the meaning of the following extract
from an author who has done so much good educational
as well as episcopal work, and has manifested such an
openness to new truth, that I differ from him with diffidence
where I may possibly have misunderstood his
meaning, and with regret where I am confident that I
have understood him correctly. The passage is from
Bishop Temple’s Bampton Lectures,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a> and I will give it
at full length, partly because I may have to refer to it
again, partly because I am afraid of misinterpreting it
if I separate one or two sentences from the context:</p>

<p class='c014'>“We have to ask what evidence can be given that any such miracles as are
recorded in the Bible have ever been worked? It is plain at once that the
answer must be given by the New Testament. No <i>such</i><a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a> evidence can now
be produced on behalf of the miracles of the Old Testament. The times are
remote; the date and authorship of the Books not established with certainty;
<i>the mixture of poetry with history, no longer capable of any sure separation
into its parts</i>; and, if the New Testament did not exist, it would be impossible
to show such a distinct preponderance of probability as could justify
us in calling many [? any] to accept the miraculous parts of the narrative as
historically true.”</p>

<p class='c012'>If I understand this argument, I fear I must dissent
from it. But let us try at least to understand it. Dr.
Temple admits (what I should not be disposed to have
admitted without a good deal of qualification) that “the
mixture of <i>poetry with history</i>” (and the context makes it
clear that he is referring to the miraculous accounts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the Old Testament) is “no longer capable of any sure
separation into its parts.” This is a very important
admission indeed. A plain Englishman may miss, at
first sight, the full importance of it. He may be disposed
to say, “What does this matter to me? What
do I care whether a miracle is told in poetry or in prose,
provided only it is true?” But by “poetry” Dr. Temple
does not mean “verse;” he means hyperbole, poetic
figures of speech and metaphors; in plain English, he
means language that is literally and historically untrue.
Consequently the admission amounts to this, that it is now
no longer possible in the miraculous narratives of the Old
Testament to separate what is historically true from what
is historically untrue. If this be so, I cannot understand
how the question is substantially affected by the New
Testament. Let us suppose for a moment that, many
centuries after the times of Moses and Samson, real
miracles were wrought by Christ and the apostles; suppose
even, in addition, that the reality of the miracles wrought
by Christ and his followers could constitute any evidence
for the Mosaic Miracles or could refute the evidence
against such stories as that of the Ass’s jawbone; yet
even then, what is the use of knowing that there may be
a miracle somewhere concealed in an Old Testament
narrative in which it is impossible to “make any sure
separation” of the historically true from the historically
untrue?</p>

<p class='c006'>But for my part I am quite unable to adopt either of
these suppositions. I cannot see how “a distinct preponderance
of probability” for the Samsonian myth or
the story of the stopping of the sun could be secured by
the fact that miracles were really, long afterwards, performed
by Christ. All that could fairly be said, as it
seems to me, would be this, that since miracles were
actually wrought by the Redeemer of the race, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Himself a child of Israel, it is not so improbable as before
that miracles might have been also wrought by other
previous deliverers of Israel. But this could not go far,
and certainly cannot constitute “a distinct preponderance
of probability,” if we find positive evidence for a
miracle almost wanting, and negative evidence against it
very strong.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>So far as Dr. Temple’s argument has weight, so far it
appears to me to be capable of being used in the opposite
direction to that which he intended. For if there is any
connection between the miracles of the Old and of the
New Testament, so that the probability of the latter may
be fairly said—I will not say to constitute “a distinct
preponderance of probability,” but to contribute slightly
to the probability of the former, then surely we must
also admit that the demonstrated improbability of the
former must contribute slightly to the <i>a priori</i> improbability
which we ought to attach to the latter. If the
Bible is to be regarded as a whole, and Bible miracles as
a whole, then the fact that the Divine Author of the Bible
allowed revelation in the earlier part of the Book to be
conveyed through an imperfect and non-historical medium
will constitute a reasonable probability that He may also
have conveyed His later revelations through the same
means. In other words, the acknowledged presence of
the law of “Truth through Illusion” in the Old Testament
should prepare us not to be disappointed if we find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>the same law traceable in the New Testament: and the
collapse of miracles in the former should prepare us for a
collapse of miracles in the latter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Do not however suppose for a moment that a collapse
of miracles implies a collapse of the Bible, and do not be
disheartened by such expressions as that “the mixture of
poetry with history is no longer capable of any sure
separation into its parts.” If that expression refers
merely to some of the legends of the times of the Patriarchs,
or to a few isolated passages elsewhere, it may be
accepted without fear; but it cannot apply to the great
bulk of the history of the Chosen People. Here you will
find very little difficulty in rejecting the obviously non-historical
and miraculous element; and you will lose
nothing by the rejection. Read through Stanley’s <i>Lectures
on the Jewish Church</i> and ask yourself whether you have
missed anything from the campaigns of Joshua and the
exploits of Gideon and Samson because the miracles
have vanished from his pages. Where miraculous
narratives are manifestly not deliberate fabrications, but
(as here) late prosaic interpretations of early poetic
traditions, they very often afford trustworthy evidence of
ancient historical events which imprinted themselves upon
the hearts of a simple people. Certainly I can say for
myself that I never realized Israel as a nation and had not
half my present appreciation of the wisdom and wonder
of the deliverance and training of Israel by Jehovah till
I had learned to interpret the miracles as being nothing
more than man’s inadequate attempt to set forth in visible
shape the unique redemption of the Chosen People.
Spiritually as well as intellectually, my enjoyment of the
Old Testament has been doubled ever since I have been
able, however imperfectly, to separate the historical element
in it from the non-historical, and to interpret the
prose as prose and the poetry as poetry.</p>

  <h2 id='let15' class='c004'>XV <br /> THE MIRACLES OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>You demur to the parallel that I draw between the
Old Testament and the New Testament; “The Battle of
Beth-horon can be disentangled from the miracle of the
stopping of the sun, just as the battles of Salamis and
Regillus can be disentangled from the visions which are
said to have accompanied them: and so of other Old
Testament narratives. But is it possible,” you ask, “that
the life of Christ can be disentangled from miracles? Do
not His own words and doctrine imply a continual assumption
that He had power to do ‘mighty works’ superior
to those of ordinary men?”</p>

<p class='c006'>You could not have put your question more happily:
for you unconsciously illustrate the almost universal confusion—common
to a great number of theologians and
agnostics as well as to the ordinary Bible reader—between
“miracles” and “mighty works.” You are really asking
not one but two questions. Your first question asks about
“miracles;” by which you mean some kind of suspension
of a law of nature, or, if you prefer it, some act
not conceived as explicable in accordance with any
natural law by the person who is attempting explanation.
Your second question asks about “mighty works,”
a phrase of constant occurrence in the New Testament,
by which phrase we may understand works superior
to the works of ordinary persons, but not necessarily
suspensions of the laws of nature. Works may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“mighty” and yet quite explicable in accordance with
natural law.</p>

<p class='c006'>You seem to expect a No to your first question and a
Yes to your second. I answer Yes to both. (1) The life
of Christ can be disentangled from “miracles.” (2) Christ
always assumed that He could do “mighty works,” and
from them His life cannot be separated.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a law of human nature that the mind influences the
body. By acting on the imagination and the emotions men
have in all ages consciously or unconsciously effected
instantaneous cures in accordance with natural laws.
There has been much quackery and deception mixed up
with cures of this kind; but no physician, and no man of
any general information, would doubt that such cures
have been and still are performed. The Jansenists,
subjected to the test of hostile observation, had some
undeniable successes of this nature. Every one has
heard of the so-called “miracles” of Lourdes; and no
unprejudiced person would deny that amid possible exaggerations
and (I greatly fear) some frauds, they have
contained an element of reality. “Faith-healing” is
going on in England during this very year; and in the
very place where I am now writing I heard a captain of
the Salvation Army just now give out a notice that,
besides a “free and easy meeting,” and a “holiness meeting,”
and sundry other meetings, there is to be a meeting
on one evening this week for the purpose of “casting out
devils.” If I go there, I shall probably see attempts,
with partial success, to excite a paralytic to motion, or to
arouse some one from a dull stupor approximating to
insanity. These attempts, even though immensely assisted
by the intense interest and sympathetic demonstrations
of the spectators, will probably produce only a
temporary effect; and when it passes away the patient
will very likely be worse than before. But the law of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>nature is the same with all; in modern times with the
Jansenists, the miracle-workers of Lourdes, the “faith-healers,”
and the Salvation Army, and in ancient days
with the priests of Æsculapius. Cures can be effected
by a strong emotional shock, sometimes of a gross kind
such as mere terror or violent excitement, sometimes of a
much purer kind, an ecstatic hope and trust. A marked
distinction must of course be made between those cures
which can, and those which cannot, be effected by appeal
to the emotions. Paralysis (called in the New Testament
“palsy”), mental disease (often called in the New Testament
“possession”), and various kinds of nervous disorder,
are all susceptible of emotional cure: but the loss
of a limb cannot be so cured. The cure of a man sick
of the palsy by the emotional method would be a miracle
for spectators of the first century, but it would not be a
miracle for us now; that is to say, it would be explicable
by us, but not by them, in accordance with known natural
laws: but the restoration of a lost limb by faith would
be a miracle for them and for us alike: we know nothing
of any natural law in accordance with which such an act
could be performed by any degree of faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now it will be admitted by all that the great majority
of Christ’s “mighty works” were acts of healing, and
that many of these were expressly attributed by Him to
faith. “Seeing their faith” is the preface, in each of the
three Synoptic Gospels, to the account of the cure of the
paralytic man, and it is a very curious preface; for it
seems to shew that Jesus recognized a kind of sponsorial
and contagious efficacy of faith in that instance (as also
in the case of the father of the epileptic boy); and we
know by modern experience of “faith-healing” how great
is the influence of a sympathetic and trustful audience.
Elsewhere, “Thy faith hath made thee whole,” “According
to your faith be it unto you,” “Great is thy faith, be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>it unto thee even as thou wilt,” “Thy faith hath saved
thee,” “If thou canst believe, all things are possible,”
“Believe ye that I am able to do this?” “Be not afraid,
only believe”—these and similar expressions lead us to
conclude that many of the “mighty works” of Jesus
were conditional on faith. Perhaps it might startle you
if I were to say that Jesus was not able to perform a
“mighty work” unless faith was present; yet if I said
this, I should only be repeating what St. Mark (vi. 5),
the earliest of the Evangelists, says on a certain occasion,
that on account of the general unbelief at Nazareth Jesus
<i>was not able</i> (οὐκ ἐδύνατο) to do there any mighty work,
“save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and
healed them.” This confession is so frank and almost
scandalizing in its plainness that we cannot be surprised
that the later Evangelist, in his parallel narrative, softens
it down by omitting the words “was not able,” and by
inserting “many.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a>  We need by no means infer from
this narrative that Jesus attempted “mighty works” and
failed. It may be that He did not attempt them because
He discerned the faithlessness of those around Him,
and felt His own consequent inability. But, interpret it
as we may, this passage remains a most important confirmation
of the other passages in which Jesus Himself
implies the necessity of faith. Where there was no faith,
there Jesus “<i>was not able</i> to do any mighty work;” and
this limit to His power Jesus Himself recognized.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here then we find at once a remarkable difference
between most of the “mighty works” of Jesus and the
“miracles” of the Old Testament. The former were conditional
on faith, and, this condition suggests that many
of them may be explicable on natural laws; the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>have no condition attached to them and there is nothing
to suggest that they are explicable on any natural law.
Indeed the miracles of the Old Testament are very often
wrought, not as a natural response to belief, but as a
rebuke to unbelief: thus the hand of Moses is made
leprous one moment and pure the next, in order to inspire
him with faith; Gideon lays out a fleece on the
grass, and the laws of nature are suspended for the
purpose of making it wet to-day and dry to-morrow,
simply in order that his unbelieving heart may be encouraged
by a sign from God; the faithless Ahaz is
encouraged by God in the Old Testament to ask for
that very favour which Christ in the New Testament
systematically refused to the Pharisees—a sign from
heaven: and for the sake of Hezekiah (who asks “What
shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me?”) the dial
goes miraculously backward! Could contrast be more
complete?</p>

<p class='c006'>It follows that we shall be acting hastily if we place
the “mighty works” of Jesus on the same level as the
“miracles” of the Old Testament, inasmuch as the former
are (in the strict sense of the term) “mighty works,”
while the latter (again in the strict sense of the term) are
“miracles.” But in addition to this reason, derivable
from the nature of the works themselves, there is another
reason, derivable from the evidence, for drawing a distinction.
Besides the direct testimony of the Gospels,
we have other testimony, indirect but even more cogent,
to prove that Jesus wrought wonderful cures. The earliest
of the Gospels was probably not composed in its present
shape till more than a generation had passed away after
the death of Christ; and, during the lapse of thirty years
evidence—especially if handed down by oral, and that
too Oriental, tradition—may undergo many corruptions.
But the letters of St. Paul are earlier, some of them much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>earlier; and many of them are of such an unaffected, personal,
informal nature that it is absolutely impossible to
suppose that they were written to express a conviction
that the writer did not feel, or to make the readers believe
in truths which were no truths. Now in his letters St.
Paul quietly assumes that many of his fellow-Christians,
and he himself in particular, had the power of working
wonderful cures without the ordinary means<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a>. He even
sets down this power as one among many “gifts” or
“graces” vouchsafed to the Church, and he places it by
no means high in the list. A man must be absolutely
destitute of all power of literary and historical criticism,
if he can persuade himself that these expressions in St.
Paul’s letters had no basis of fact, and that they were
inserted, though unmeaning both to the writer and to the
hearers, in order to delude posterity into a false belief.
There is nothing in the Epistles to indicate the nature of
the diseases which were cured by St. Paul and his
followers. We may conjecture with much probability
that they were nervous diseases, paralysis, “possession,”
and the like, such as might be acted on by the “emotional
shock” of faith: and the conjecture is confirmed
by the fact that, in the time of Josephus, healers of demoniacs
were very common in Palestine; and certain
Jews of Ephesus are recorded in the Acts of the Apostles
to have tried an experiment, after Paul’s manner, in
attempting to cure a case of one “possessed.” But be
this as it may, the fact that St. Paul and St Paul’s contemporaries
unquestionably cured some kinds of diseases
in the name of Jesus, and did this after some sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>system, by the utterance of the name of Jesus, without
the ordinary means, is a very strong confirmation of the
accuracy of the Gospels in attributing to Jesus the power
of working instantaneous cures. It would be strange
indeed that the Disciples, and not the Master, should
have had such powers.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have laid stress upon the fact that Jesus wrought
“mighty” but natural cures, in the first place, because it
ought to increase our appreciation of His personal influence
and power over the souls of men, to know that He
not only possessed this power in an unprecedented degree
but also communicated it to His disciples; and secondly,
because the fact that He performed these “mighty works”
has naturally led people, from the earliest times down to
the present day, to infer that He performed “miracles.”
Even at the present time you will find that the great mass
of Christians make no distinction at all between healing
a paralytic or a demoniac or a dumb man, and restoring a
severed ear or blasting a fig-tree; all alike seem to them
“miracles.” If this is so even in these days, in spite of
physiology, you cannot be surprised that the first Christians
and their followers made no such distinction; they
assumed that the man who could heal a paralytic by a
word could heal any other disease in the same way, and
do any other work he pleased contrary to the course of
nature. This belief would prepare the way for attributing to
Jesus other works of a very different kind, real “miracles,”
that is, suspensions of the laws of nature. Considering
the multitude of such acts recorded in the Old Testament
as having been performed by Moses, Elijah, Elisha and
others, we may well be surprised to find how very few
have been attributed to Jesus: and I believe it can
be shown that each of these few has originated from
some misunderstanding, and without any intention to
deceive. Of almost all of these real “miracles,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>to have been wrought by Christ, I believe we are justified
in saying with Bishop Temple that, if we take each by
itself, we cannot find for it any “clear, and unmistakeable,
and sufficient evidence.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a> So far from being an exaggeration
this is rather an understatement of the case:
there is not only no “clear and unmistakeable and sufficient
evidence” for them, there is also very strong indirect
evidence against some of them. In some future letter
I may deal in detail with these miracles; for the present
I will select only one.</p>

<p class='c006'>This one shall be the most striking of all the miracles
in the New Testament, a miracle exceeding in wonder
even the raising of Lazarus. It is found only in St.
Matthew’s Gospel, and describes an incident that followed
immediately on the death of Jesus. Here are the exact
words:</p>

<p class='c014'>“And the earth did quake, and the tombs were opened; and many bodies
of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised; and coming forth out of the
tombs after his resurrection they entered into the Holy City and appeared
unto many.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Have I at all exaggerated this miracle in declaring
it to be more startling than even the raising of Lazarus?
It records the resurrection, not of one man, but of
many. Nor are we allowed by the author to suppose
that he referred to visions of the dead, appearing unto
friends; for he tells us that “the <i>tombs were opened</i>, and
many <i>bodies</i> of the saints arose.” Moreover this would
appear to have been a miracle not wrought in private as
many of the mighty works of Jesus were, nor a sight vouchsafed
to a chosen few (like the manifestations of Jesus
after death); for these “bodies” went into Jerusalem,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>during the Passover, at a time when the city was
thronged with visitors, and “appeared unto many.” What
subsequently became of these “bodies”—whether they
remained on earth till the Ascension when they ascended
with Jesus, or whether they lived their lives over again
and were buried a second time, or whether they went
back to their tombs again after they had appeared in
Jerusalem—is a question of some difficulty, which has
exercised the minds of commentators and has been
answered rather variously than satisfactorily. Be this as
it may, the miracle must be confessed by all to be
stupendous.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now for the evidence of it. I have been quoting from
St. Matthew’s account of this miracle. What would a
dispassionate and intelligent heathen say of it, coming
for the first time to the study of our four Gospels? Would
it not be something of this sort: “Here you call on me
to believe a miracle that appears to me to be motiveless
and is certainly singularly startling: but I will suspend
my judgment of it till I hear the accounts given by your
other three Evangelists. What do they say of the effect
produced upon the disciples and bystanders by this earthquake
and this most extraordinary resurrection? There
were present the women that loved and followed Jesus,
there was the Roman centurion, there were ‘many’ who
witnessed the appearances of the dead: even to those
who were not present, an earthquake rending the rocks
in the neighbourhood could not be imperceptible: what
therefore is said on these points by other contemporary
authors as well as by your four Gospels? Tell me
that first; and then I will tell you what I think of the
miracle.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In answer to this request, which I think we must
characterize as a very natural one, we should have first
to admit that no profane author makes any mention of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>the resurrection of these numerous “bodies,” nor of the
earthquake that accompanied it. Then we should have
to set down the four records of the four Evangelists as
follows:</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>You see then that this extraordinary incident, startling
enough to be the very centre of a galaxy of wonders, is
omitted by <i>three out of the four Evangelists</i>. You see
also that two of the Evangelists agree with St. Matthew in
placing a centurion at the foot of the cross, and in assigning
to him expressions of faith: but neither of them
mentions the “earthquake” as being even a partial cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>of the centurion’s faith, nor is there so much as a
hint of any resurrection of the “bodies of saints” from
the tombs.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now if you and I, with full knowledge of the facts,
were writing a biography of a great man, we might undoubtedly
exhibit many variations and divergences in our
story. Every biographer who knows everything about a
man must omit something; many things therefore that
you would omit, I should insert, and <i>vice versâ</i>. But suppose
we were writing in some detail the description of
the great man’s execution (as the crucifixion is written in
great detail by the Evangelists), and, in particular, the
emotion and utterances of the soldier who superintended the
execution. Is it possible under these circumstances that
you should relate (and with truth) that the soldier’s emotion
was caused in part by an earthquake which happened
at the moment of the man’s death—adding also that a
large number of people rose at the same time bodily from
the graves—and that I, with a full knowledge that both
these facts are true, should make no mention at all either
of the earthquake or of this stupendous resurrection? I
say that such an omission of facts is absolutely impossible
in any sincere and straightforward biographer, <i>on the supposition
that he knows them</i>. The argument that “it is
unsafe to argue from silence” is quite inapplicable here:
nor is it in point to allege the silence of a courtly historian
who writes the life of Constantine but omits the Emperor’s
execution of his son. The answer is that we have not
here to do with courtly historians, but with simple
unsophisticated compilers of tradition whose main object
was to set down in truth and honesty all that could shew
Jesus of Nazareth to be the Son of God. Now it is impossible
that the Evangelists should not have recognized in
this miracle, if true, a cogent proof—cogent for the minds of
men in these days—of the divine mission of Jesus: we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>therefore driven to the conclusion that they omitted it either
because they had never heard of it, or because although
they had heard of it, they did not believe it to be true.</p>

<p class='c006'>You must not however suppose that this evidently
legendary narrative was added with any intent to falsify.
Like many of the miraculous accounts in the Old Testament,
this story is probably the result of misunderstanding—an
allegory misinterpreted. The death of Christ
abolished the gulf between God and man; it tore down
the veil between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies,
whereby Christ took mankind, in Himself and with Himself,
into the direct presence of the Father: and this
spiritual truth found a literal interpretation in two of the
Gospels which mention the “rending of the veil.” But
Christ’s death did more than this. It struck down the
power of death itself: it broke open the tombs, and prepared
the way for the Resurrection of the Saints; and
this spiritual truth, being misinterpreted as if it were
literally true, gave rise to a tradition (which does not however
seem to have been widely received) that at the
moment of Christ’s death certain tombs were actually
broken open, and certain of “the Saints” rose bodily from
the dead and walked into Jerusalem.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 id='let16' class='c004'>XVI <br /> THE GROWTH OF THE GOSPELS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>You force me to digress. My object just now was to
shew that the life of Christ (no less than the history of
the redemption of Israel) can be disentangled from
“miracles”, although not from “mighty works”; and I
proposed to take the six or seven principal miracles
attributed to Christ by the Synoptists and to shew of each
account that it may have naturally and easily crept into
the Gospels without any intention to deceive.</p>

<p class='c006'>But you will not let me go on in my own way; for you
ask a question that claims immediate answer, and something
more than a mere Yes or No: “Did or did not,
the Publican and Apostle St. Matthew write the Gospel
attributed to him? And if he did, how can he have
suffered a ‘legendary’ miracle to ‘creep into’ his
narrative? The same question,” you add, “applies to the
Gospel of St. John. If these two Gospels, as they stand,
were written by Apostles, that is, by personal disciples of
Jesus and eye-witnesses of the events they profess to
describe, then there is no alternative; either Jesus wrought
miracles, or the Apostles lied. No eye-witness can err as
you suppose some one (I know not whom) to have
erred, by interpreting metaphor as though it were literal
statement. Imagine Boswell, for example, misinterpreting
some metaphorical expression concerning Dr. Johnson to
the effect that ‘the great lexicographer was exalted by his
countrymen to the pinnacle of honour and fame’ and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>consequently inferring that his statue was set up on a
column like Lord Nelson or the Duke of York! The
notion is too grotesque. If then Jesus did not perform
miracles we are forced to conclude either that the Apostles
deceived us or that the Gospels bearing their names are
forgeries. Which is it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to meet this objection I must say a few words
about the composition of the Gospels. For indeed your
question shews a complete misapprehension of the manner
in which the Gospels grew up, and of the ancient
notions about authorship. In particular, you are far too
free in the use of the word “forgeries.” The book called
the <i>Wisdom of Solomon</i> contains some of the noblest
sentiments that have ever found eloquent expression, and
yet the philosophic author who composed it (probably in
Alexandria about eight or nine centuries after Solomon’s
death) does not hesitate to appeal to the Almighty in
words by which he ascribes the authorship to Solomon
himself: “Thou hast chosen me to be a king of Thy
people and a judge of Thy sons and daughters: Thou
hast commanded me to build a temple upon Thy Holy
mount,” (ix. 7, 8). Now do you call him a forger? The
book of Ecclesiastes, one of our own canonical books,
declares that it was written by “the son of David, king in
Jerusalem” and that the author was a “King over Israel
in Jerusalem,” (i. 1-12). No one now (worth mentioning)
believes these statements to be true. Yet would you call
the composer of Ecclesiastes a forger? Probably in
both cases the authors felt that they were honouring the
memory of the great king in thus introducing new truths
to the world under the protection of his name. I believe
many other instances might be given of the literary laxity
of ancient times. But besides, in the case of the Gospels,
you must remember that authorship hardly came into
question at all events for a long time. The story of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>life of Christ would be, in some shape, current among the
Church as the common property of all, as soon as the
Apostles began to proclaim the Gospel. Probably it was
not, for some time, reduced to writing. Among the Jews
the Old Testament was spoken of as Writing or Scripture;
but their most revered and sacred comments on it were
retained in oral tradition: and hence all through the
New Testament you will find that “Scripture” refers to
the Old Testament, and that no mention is made of the
doctrine about Christ except as “tradition” or “teaching.”
What therefore would probably at first be current in the
Church, perhaps for thirty or forty years after Christ’s death,
would be simply a number of “traditions” or oral versions of
the Gospel, current perhaps in different shapes at the great
ecclesiastical centres, such as Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus,
Alexandria, Rome, yet presenting a general affinity, and
all claiming to represent “the Memoirs of the Apostles”
or to be “the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It ought not to seem strange to you that the Church
could exist, and the Good Tidings be preached for
some years without the aid of written Gospels. Did not
St. Paul preach the Gospel in his letters? Surely he
preached it very effectually: yet his letters do not contain
a single quotation from any written Gospel.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The same
may be said of the letters attributed to St. Peter, St.
James, and St. John: not one quotes a single saying of
Christ, or contains a phrase that can be said, with certainty,
to be borrowed from our Gospels. The book of
the Acts of the Apostles, the earliest summary of Church
history, contains many speeches by Apostles, one by St.
James, some by St. Peter and several by St. Paul: in all
these speeches only one saying of our Lord is quoted; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>that is a saying not found in any of our extant Gospels.
Conjecture might have led us to conclude that this would
be so. We might reasonably have inferred that, as long
as the Church had in its midst the Apostles and their
companions, and as long also as they daily expected that
Christ would “come”, the notion of committing the Gospel
to writing for posterity would seem superfluous, distasteful,
almost implying a want of faith. But when we find this conjecture
confirmed by the undeniable fact that the earliest
teachers and preachers of the Gospel, in their teaching as it
is handed down to us, made no use whatever of our written
Gospels, we may regard it as a safe conclusion that, during
the first generation after the crucifixion, written Gospels
were neither widely used nor much needed.</p>

<p class='c006'>But soon the need would arise. One after another the
Apostles and their companions would pass away, and
Christ’s immediate “coming” would now be less and less
sanguinely anticipated. The great mass of the earliest
Christians were either Jews or proselytes to the Jewish
religion; but now the Gentiles, who had come to Christ
without first passing through the Law of Moses, would
become the majority in the Church; and for them the
Old Testament would not have the same pre-eminent
title as “Writing” or “Scripture.” For these Gentiles
too the old Rabbinical prejudice against committing the
teaching of the Church to writing would have no weight.
Now therefore in several churches simultaneous efforts
would be made to write down the traditions current
amongst the brethren; and hence we find St. Luke prefacing
his own Gospel with the remark that he was
induced to attempt this task because “many” others had
attempted it. St. Luke could hardly have written thus if
one authentic and apostolic document already occupied the
ground and stood pre-eminent in the Church as the written
record of Christ’s life by an eye-witness. That there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>no such document, known to St. Luke, we may also infer
from his acknowledgment of his obligations to those who
were “eye-witnesses and ministers of the word.” It says
that he shapes his narrative “as they handed down the
tradition” for that is the meaning of his word not “as
they <i>wrote</i> the tradition.” You must have noticed that
the extant titles of the Gospels declare them to have
been written not “by,” but “according to” their several
authors. The explanation (which has not been successfully
impugned) is that, even in the later times in which their
titles were given, the old belief continued, that the men
who compiled them did no more than commit to writing
their version of a tradition already current. They did not
compose, they reported, the tradition; the Gospel was
supposed to be the same in all Churches, but here
“according to” one version or writer, there “according to”
another. The Apostles, being with one or two exceptions
mere fishermen and unlearned men, ignorant of letters,
could not very well be supposed to be authors of written
compositions; but St. Matthew, being a tax-gatherer, would
necessarily be an expert writer, and therefore one of the
earliest traditions committed to writing would be naturally
attributed to his penmanship. But the evidence for St.
Matthew’s authorship appears, when tested, to be extremely
slight. It was the universal belief of the early
Church that the Gospel according to St. Matthew was
originally written in Hebrew, and Jerome has quoted,
as coming from the Hebrew original, a passage not found
in our Greek Gospel of St. Matthew. Even when this
Gospel is quoted by the earliest writers, it is frequently
quoted inexactly, and never connected by them with the
name of St. Matthew as the author. We ought not to
infer from these unnamed and inexact quotations that the
writers did not recognize St. Matthew as the author
for their habit is almost invariably to quote Gospels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>simply as Gospel, inexactly, and without mentioning the
name of the Evangelist. But this unfortunate habit
leaves us without any early and trustworthy evidence for
St. Matthew’s authorship. On the whole, then, there is
very little evidence for supposing that any part of our
present Gospel according to St. Matthew was written by
an Apostle or by an eye-witness of Christ’s life, and
there is very much evidence tending to show that such a
supposition is extremely improbable.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even if we grant that parts of the Gospel were composed
by an Apostle, it by no means follows that the
whole was. There was a very natural tendency, in the
earliest days of the Church—when the traditional Gospel
was as it were everybody’s property and had not yet
acquired the authority of Scripture—to make the tradition
as full, as edifying, and as correct, as possible. If we
may judge from the style of the book of Revelation
(which is said on rather more substantial grounds than
are generally alleged for the authorship of most of the
books of the New Testament, to have been the work of
the Apostle John) the earliest Greek traditions must have
been composed in an ungrammatical, mongrel kind of
Greek, which must have been as distasteful to the well-educated
Christian as cockney English or pigeon English
would be to us. This could not long be tolerated in
traditions that were repeated in the presence of the whole
congregation; and alterations of style, for edification,
would naturally facilitate alterations of matter, also for
edification. The love of completeness would introduce
many corrections and sometimes corruptions. Often,
in those early times, the teacher, catechist, or scribe,
who knew some additional fact tending to Christ’s glory,
and not mentioned in the tradition or document, would
think that he was not doing his duty if he did not add it
to his oral or written version of the tradition. Even in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>MSS. of the fourth or fifth centuries we have abundant
instances to shew how this tendency multiplied interpolations;
principally by interpolating passages from one
Gospel into another, but sometimes by interpolating
traditions not found now in any Gospel with which we
are acquainted. Occasionally there are also corruptions
of omission, arising from the desire to omit difficult or
apparently inconsistent passages; but by far the more
common custom is to add. If this corrupting tendency was
in force in the fourth century when the Christian religion
was on the point of becoming the religion of the empire,
and when the sacred books of Christianity had attained
to a position of authority in the Church not a whit below
the books of the Old Testament, you may easily imagine
what a multitude of interpolations and amplifications
must have crept into the original tradition at a time when
it was still young, unauthoritative, and plastic, during the
first two or three generations that followed the death of
Christ. The result of all these considerations is that we
are not obliged and this, to my mind, is a great relief
to suppose that any passage which we may be forced to
reject from our Gospels as false, was written by an Apostle.</p>

<p class='c006'>I say this is to me a great relief, but perhaps it is not
so to you. Your notion of what the Gospels ought to be,
is perhaps borrowed from a passage in Paley’s Evidences
where he likens the evidences for the miracles of Christ to
that of twelve eye-witnesses, all ready to be martyrs in
attestation of the truth of their testimony; and you are
shocked perhaps when you find that the Gospels fall very
far indeed below the level of such a standard of evidence.
What would have seemed best to you would have been an
exact record of Christ’s teaching and acts, drawn up by
one of the Apostles in the name of the Twelve, duly
dated and signed by all, and circulated and received by
the whole Church from the day after the Ascension down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>to the present time. And I quite agree with you. But
then, as we have seen in the history of astronomy and in
the history of the Old Testament, it has not pleased God
to reveal Himself or His works to men in the way
which men have thought best. Now you are not indeed
obliged to infer that, because revelation in the Old Testament
was accompanied by illusion, therefore revelation
in the New Testament must have contained a similar
alloy; but you ought at least to be prepared for such
a discovery. For me, it would be a terrible shock indeed
if I were forced to suppose that a faithful Apostle of
the Lord Jesus Christ had wilfully misrepresented the
truth with a view to glorify His Master: but it is no
shock at all to find that the highest revelation of God to
man has been, like all other revelations, to some extent
misinterpreted, obscured, materialized. I have learned
to accept this as an inevitable law of our present nature.
If it had been God’s will to suspend this law of nature in
favour of the New Testament, I think He would have
consistently gone further, and miraculously prevented the
scribes from making errors, or posterity from perpetuating
them. But how can I think God has done this,
when I know that even the words of the Lord’s own
Prayer are variously reported in the two Gospels of St.
Matthew and St. Luke, and that every page of a critical
edition of the New Testament teems with various readings
between which the ablest commentators are perplexed
to decide?</p>

<p class='c006'>You must therefore make up your mind to believe that
the earliest Gospel traditions and even that triply attested
tradition<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a> which is common to the first three Gospels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>and which runs through the three with a separate character
of its own, like a distinguishable stream passed through
several phases before they assumed their present shape.
In my next letter I shall probably ask you to consider
what phases they passed through; but you may perhaps
expect me to say something at once about the Fourth
Gospel; for to that book many of the previous remarks
do not apply. It was much later than the rest; it has
little in subject-matter, and nothing at all in style, in
common with the rest; it contains scarcely a word of the
Common Tradition which pervades the first three Gospels;
it probably passed through no phases and suffered few
accretions; and it differs from the other Gospels, even
from St. Luke’s, in bearing a far more manifest impress
of personal authorship. The three synoptic Gospels
really agree with their titles in representing the Gospel
“according to” their several authors; but the Fourth
Gospel (although, like the rest, preceded by “according
to”) is a Gospel written “by” whoever wrote it.</p>

<p class='c006'>The question is, who did write it? If it was written by
an Apostle, an eye-witness of the life of Christ, then we
have to face—I am not sure we have to accept—your
alternative: “Either Jesus worked miracles, or the
Apostles lied.” But there is very little evidence (worth
calling evidence) for the hypothesis that an Apostle
wrote it, and much evidence against that hypothesis.
St. John, the reputed author, is said, on the evidence of
Justin Martyr, to have written the Apocalypse; which,
while it resembles in style what we might have expected
from a Galilean fisherman, differs entirely from the style
of the Fourth Gospel. Whoever wrote the Gospel, we
may be sure that he did not reproduce the words
of Jesus, but gave rather what appeared to him to be
their latent and spiritual meaning. This can be proved
as follows. Suppose three writers—say Boswell, Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Thrale, and Goldsmith—had composed accounts of the life
and sayings of Dr. Johnson, widely differing in the subject-matter
and style of the narrative, but closely agreeing in
the character of Johnson’s thoughts, as reported by them,
and very often agreeing in the actual words imputed to
Johnson; and suppose a fourth writer, say Burke, had
written his reminiscences of Dr. Johnson, which entirely
differed in language, in thought, and in subject-matter from
the first three: would you not say at once that this was
strong proof, that Burke did not report Dr. Johnson’s actual
words, and that he had probably tinged them with his
own style and thought? But if furthermore Burke reported
Dr. Johnson’s words and long discourses <i>in the same
language as he reported Sheridan’s, and in language
indistinguishable from his own contextual narrative</i>, then
you would, I am sure, find it difficult to be patient with
any one who, through force of prejudice and pleasing
associations, obstinately maintained that Burke’s biography
was equally faithful and exact with the three other
concordant or synoptic biographies. Now this comparison
exactly represents the facts. You will find several of the
most learned and painstaking commentators differing as
to where the introductory words of the author of the Fourth
Gospel cease, and where John the Baptist’s words begin;
and the style of our Lord’s discourses in the Fourth Gospel
is quite indistinguishable from the style of the author
himself. As to the immense difference, in respect of style
and thought and subject-matter, between the Synoptic
Gospels, and the Fourth Gospel, you must have felt it,
even as a child, reading them in English.</p>

<p class='c006'>I must refer you to the article on “Gospels” in the
<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> for what I believe to be the most
probable explanation of the origin of this remarkable work.
It is there shown that there are extraordinary points of similarity
between the emblematic language and emblematic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>acts attributed to Jesus in the Fourth Gospel, and the
emblematic conceptions of the Alexandrine philosopher
Philo, who flourished some sixty or seventy years before
that Gospel was written. Dealing, for instance, with
the dialogue between Jesus and the woman of Samaria
near the well at Sychem, the writer of that article shews
that, in the works of Philo, the well is an emblem of the
search after knowledge; Sychem is an emblem of
materialism; the “five husbands”, or, as Philo calls them,
“five seducers” represent the five senses so that the
whole dialogue appears to contain a poetic appeal to the
heathen world, to turn from the materialistic knowledge
which can never satisfy, to the knowledge of the Word of
God which is the “living water”. Still more remarkable
is Philo’s emblematic use of Lazarus (or Eleazar, for the
words are the same) as a type of dead humanity, helpless
and lifeless till it has been raised up by the help of the
Lord. But into this I have no space to enter. If you
care to pursue the subject, I must refer you to the article
above mentioned. Canon Westcott has pointed out that
in arrangement and structure the Fourth Gospel has
some distinct poetic features. I should go further and
say that, in this Gospel, History is subordinated to poetic
purpose, and that its narratives of incidents, resting
sometimes on a basis of fact, but more often on a basis
of metaphor, are intended not so much to describe incidents
as to lead the reader to spiritual conclusions.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have no account of the authorship of the Fourth
Gospel till the year 170 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, and this we find to be
“already legendary.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a> It is there said that, being
requested by his fellow-disciples and bishops to write
a Gospel, John desired them to fast for three days and
then to relate to one another what revelation each had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>received. It was then revealed to the Apostle Andrew
that “while all endeavoured to recall their experiences,
John should write <i>everything in his own name</i>”. No
confidence can be placed in the exactness of testimony
that comes so long after the event; but it points to some
kind of joint contribution or revision such as is implied
in John xxi. 24: “This is the disciple which testifieth of
these things and <i>we know</i> that his testimony is true.”
That the Gospel was written “in the name of John” by
some pupil of his—perhaps by some namesake—and
revised and issued in the name of John by the Elders of
the Ephesian Church, is by no means improbable. In
some matters of fact, for example in distinguishing between
the Passover and “the last supper,” the Fourth Gospel
corrects an (apparent) error of the Synoptic Gospels, a
correction that possibly proceeded from the Apostle
John; and perhaps the solemn asseveration as to the
issue of blood and water from the side of Jesus (“And
he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is
true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may
believe”) may be a reminiscence of some special testimony
from the aged Apostle; but it is impossible to ascertain
how far emblematic and historical narratives are blended
in such passages as the dialogue with the Samaritan
woman, the miracle at Cana, and the raising of Lazarus.
The author was convinced (like every other believer, at
that time) that Jesus <i>did</i> work many miracles, and <i>could</i>
have worked any kind of miracle; but he had noted the
unspiritual tendency to magnify the “mighty works” of
Jesus as merely “mighty:” he therefore selected from
the traditions before him those in which the spiritual and
emblematic meaning was predominant. In doing this,
he sometimes took a spiritual metaphor and expanded it
into a spiritual history. Again, he had also noted an
unspiritual tendency to lay undue stress upon the exact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>words of Jesus; and he therefore determined—besides
giving prominence to the promise of Jesus concerning
His Spirit, which was to guide the disciples into all truth—to
exhibit, in his Gospel, the spiritual purport of Christ’s
doctrine rather than to repeat each saying as it was
actually delivered.</p>

<p class='c006'>As I write these words, with the pages of the Gospel
open before me, my eye falls upon the story of the raising
of Lazarus: “Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection
and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet
shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth on me
shall never die.” Is it possible, I say to myself, that
Jesus did <i>not</i> say these entrancing words? And how
often does the same question arise as one turns over the
leaves: “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto
you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you:” “Yet a
little while and the world beholdeth me no more; but ye
behold me: because I live, ye shall live also.” Could any
one at any time have invented such sayings? Still less,
is it possible they could have been invented in the times
of Trajan or Hadrian by any Asiatic Greek or Alexandrian
Jew? But truth compels me to answer that, just as the
Asiatic Jew St. Paul, although he never saw or heard
Jesus, was inspired by the Spirit of Jesus to utter words
of spiritual truth and beauty worthy of Jesus Himself, so
an Asiatic Greek or Alexandrian Jew of the time of Trajan
may have been prompted by the same Spirit to penetrate
to the very depths of the meaning of Jesus and to express
some of the conclusions to be derived from His sayings
more clearly than we can see them even in the words of
Jesus Himself, as they are recorded in the Synoptic
Gospels. I do not see on what principle we can so limit
the operation of the Holy Spirit as to say it could not
extend, in its most perfect force, beyond the age of
Domitian or Nerva or even Trajan. Having before me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the doctrine of the Synoptic Gospels, I am forbidden by
mere considerations of style and literary criticism from
believing that Jesus used the exact words, “I am the true
vine,” “I am the good shepherd,” “I am the light of
the world,” “I am the resurrection and the life;” but I
accept these sayings as divinely inspired, and as being
far deeper and fuller expressions of the spiritual nature of
Jesus than any of the inferences which I could draw for
myself from the Synoptic doctrine. Do not then say
that I “reject” the Fourth Gospel. I accept all that is
essential in it; and this I accept on far safer grounds than
many who would accuse me of rejecting it. For their
acceptance might be shaken to-morrow if some new
piece of evidence appeared decisively shewing that the
Gospel was not written by John the Apostle; but my
acceptance is independent of authorship, and is based
upon the testimony of my conscience.</p>

<p class='c006'>Surely you must feel that it would be absurd for one who
tests religious doctrine to some extent by experience and
by history, to reject the Fourth Gospel because it is in a
great measure emblematic, and because it was not written
by the man who was supposed to have written it. Be the
author who he may, I shall never cease to feel grateful to
him. The all-embracing sweep of view which enabled
him to look on the Incarnation as the central incident of
the world’s history and to set forth Christ as the Eternal
Word and Eternal Son, not dependent for this claim
upon a mere Miraculous Conception; the spiritual contempt
for mere “mighty works,” which leads him repeatedly
to claim faith for Jesus Himself firstly, and for
the “words” of Jesus secondly, and only as a last reserve
to demand belief “for the works’ sake;” and the true
intuition with which he fastens on the promise of Jesus
(only hinted at in the Synoptic Gospels) that He would
be present with His disciples at every time and place and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>that He would give them “a voice,” and a Spirit not to be
gainsaid—from which brief suggestion the author worked
out in detail the promise of the Holy Spirit, and predicted
the nobler and ampler future of the Church these true,
and profound, and spiritual intuitions will always excite
my deepest gratitude and admiration. The doctrine of
the Eternal Word had its origin perhaps in the schools of
Alexandria, and certainly formed no part of the teaching
of Jesus; but, Christianized as it is by the author of the
Fourth Gospel, it commends itself as a key to many
mysteries, and (like the Fourth Gospel itself) it appears
to be but one among many illustrations of the divine
development of Christian doctrine; “I have yet many
things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
Howbeit when he, the Spirit of Truth, is come, he will
guide you into all truth.” In a word, without the Fourth
Gospel, Christendom might (it would seem) have failed
forever to appreciate the true nature of its Redeemer.</p>

<p class='c006'>I cannot indeed repress some regret that this most
marvellously endowed minister and prophet of Christ
should have been allowed to select a poetic and even illusive
form in order to publish his divine truths. Hitherto
I have been able with pleasure and satisfaction to see
the illusive integument being gradually separated from
the inner truth, as in astronomy and in the history of the
Old Testament. Now comes a point where I myself
should like to recoil. But how puerile and faithless
should I be if I assumed that God would give to the
world along with His divine revelation precisely that
modicum of illusion (and no more) which I myself personally
am just able to receive with pleasure! Let us
rather follow where, as Plato says, “the argument leads
us.” Or, if you prefer me to quote from the Fourth
Gospel itself, let us follow the guidance of Him who is
both “the Way and the Truth.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>
  <h2 id='let17' class='c004'>XVII <br /> CHRISTIAN ILLUSIONS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>Once more I am compelled to digress: and, this
time, it is in order to meet what you must let me call a
preconception of yours. You say that it appears to you
“impossible that Christ, if really divine, should have
been permitted by God to be worshipped as a worker
of miracles for eighteen centuries, although in reality he
had no power to work them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Is this much more than a repetition of your former
objection that my views amount to “a new religion,” and
that illusion, although it may abound in the history of the
thoughts of mankind, can never have been permitted to
connect itself with a really divine revelation? I have
already in part answered these prejudices—for they are
nothing more—by shewing that illusion permeates what is
called “natural religion,” and by subsequently shewing
that the inspired books of the Old Testament exhibit
illusions in every page; not only the illusions of the chosen
people, but illusions also on the part of the authors of the
several books, who misinterpreted tradition so as to convert
a non-miraculous into a miraculous history. But now
let us deal more particularly with Christian illusions.
Here I will try to show you, first, how natural and
(humanly speaking) how inevitable it was that illusions
should gather round the earliest Christian traditions, and
how easily there might have sprung up miraculous accounts
in connection with them. Then, and not till then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>having done my best to dispel your natural prejudice, I
will take in detail the six or seven principal miracles attributed
to Christ by all the three Synoptic Evangelists, and
will endeavour to show you that these accounts did actually
spring up in a natural and inevitable way, after the manner
of illusions, without any attempt to deceive on the part of
the compilers of the Gospels. It will appear, I think, that
the life and doctrine of Christ are independent of these
miracles and can easily be separated from them.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the present then I am to speak of the naturalness
or inevitability of illusions gathering about Christ’s acts
and words in the minds of His disciples. Does any student
of the Fourth Gospel need to be convinced of this?
Perhaps the author of that work discerned the illusions of
the early Church even too clearly, so that he slightly
overshot the mark in the frequency of the false inferences
and misunderstandings with which he delights to encompass
the words and deeds of Jesus. Perhaps the composer of
“the Spiritual Gospel” has been led even too far by his profound
and true perception that this Incarnate Word—this
Being from another sphere who was and is in the bosom of
the Father—could not move on the earth, among earthly
creatures, without being perpetually misunderstood by them.
But is there not manifest truth in his conception of Jesus
as of One having different thoughts from those of common
men, different ways of regarding all things small or great,
a spiritual dialect of His own, not at once to be comprehended
by ordinary beings? Certain it is that, in the Fourth
Gospel, Christ’s discourses are one string of metaphors
which are literally and falsely interpreted by those to whom
they are addressed. “Flesh,” “blood,” “water,” “sleep,”
“birth,” “death,” “life,” “temple,” “bread,” “meat,”
“night,” “way,”—these and I know not how many
more simple words present themselves, as we rapidly turn
over the pages of that Gospel, always metaphorically used,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>and always misunderstood. Nor can it be said that they
were misunderstood by enemies and unbelievers alone;
His disciples constantly misunderstood them. The life of
Christ in the Fourth Gospel is one continuous misunderstanding.
I will not say that this represents the exact
fact; but I doubt not that the inspired insight of the
author, be he who he may, took in the full meaning of all
the hints that are given by the Synoptists as to the misunderstanding
of the disciples about their Master, and led
him to the deliberate conclusion that the life of Christ in
the flesh was one perpetual source of illusions to the
Twelve—illusions through which, by the guidance of the
Spirit, they were to be led to the truth: “What I do ye
know not now, but ye shall know hereafter.” I believe he
went even further and perceived that Christ’s life was in
danger of becoming a total delusion to the earliest
Christians through their tendency to the materialistic and
the miraculous, and that the best means of preserving the
Church from such a danger was to accustom the faithful
to attach value to the words and deeds of Christ only so
far as they could interpret them spiritually, trusting to the
Spirit for continual guidance into new truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>This then is my first proposition, that Christ was sure
to be misunderstood by those around Him, owing to His
manner of using the language of metaphor. You must
know very well that this conjecture is confirmed by fact.
Sometimes the Synoptists note the fact, as when He spoke
of “leaven” and the Twelve misunderstood Him literally;
and several other instances are on record. But it is of
course possible that on many other occasions the misunderstanding
may have existed, but may not have been
noted by the Evangelists. Take one instance. In the
discourse of Jesus to the Seventy Disciples (Luke x. 19)
Jesus makes the following statement: “I have given you
authority to tread upon <i>serpents and scorpions</i> and over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall in any wise
hurt (ἀδικήσει) you.” How are we to understand this
“treading upon <i>serpents and scorpions</i>”? Literally or
metaphorically? Surely the text itself makes it evident
that Jesus used the words metaphorically to refer to “the
power of the Enemy,” <i>i.e.</i> “the Serpent,” or Satan, probably
with a special reference to the casting out of devils.
Moreover the passage is introduced by a statement that
“the Seventy returned <i>with joy</i>, saying, Lord, <i>even the
devils are subject unto us in thy name</i>. And he said, I
beheld <i>Satan</i> fall as lightning from Heaven. Behold I have
given you authority to tread <i>upon serpents</i>.... <i>Howbeit</i> in
this <i>rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you</i>; but
rejoice that your names are written in Heaven.” As for
the other part of the promise, “nothing shall hurt you,” it
surely does not seem to you that these words must imply
literal “hurt”? If it does, let me direct your attention to a
much more striking instance of Christ’s extraordinary use of
metaphor in a passage where the Disciples are told, almost
in a breath, that <i>not a hair of their heads shall perish</i> and
yet that some of them shall be “<i>put to death</i>” (Luke xxi.
16-18). I think then that you will agree with me that the
“authority to tread upon <i>serpents</i>” mentioned in St. Luke
contained not a literal, but a spiritual promise, to tread
upon the power of “the Serpent.” Nevertheless, that this
promise about “serpents” was very early misinterpreted
literally can be shewn, not indeed from a genuine passage
of the Gospels, but from a very early interpolation in St.
Mark’s Gospel, xvi. 17, 18: “These signs shall follow them
that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils; they
shall speak with new tongues; they <i>shall take up serpents</i>,
and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt
them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall
recover.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here then we have a clear instance of misunderstanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>(not noted by the Evangelists) arising in very early if not
in the very earliest times from the metaphorical language
of Jesus. One more instance of probable misunderstanding
must suffice for the present. You know how often in the
Epistles of St. Paul the word “dead” is used to indicate
spiritually “dead” <i>i.e.</i> “dead in sin.” A similar use is
attributed to Christ in the Fourth Gospel: “He that
believeth in me, though he were <i>dead</i>, yet shall he live”
(John xi. 25); but here the impending resurrection of
Lazarus gives the reader the impression that it is literally
used. However it is almost certainly metaphorical in
John v. 24, 25, 28, “He that heareth my word and believeth
him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not
unto judgment, but <i>is passed from death into life</i>. Verily,
verily, I say unto you, the hour cometh and now is, when
the <i>dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they
that hear shall live</i>.... Marvel not at this, for the hour
cometh in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his
voice, and shall come forth” &amp;c. Here apparently the
meaning is that the hour has already come (“now is”)
when the spiritually dead shall hear the voice, and the hour
is on the point of coming when the literally dead (“all that
are in the tombs”) shall hear it. In any case, the metaphorical
meaning is indisputable in the striking saying
of Jesus (Luke ix. 60) “Let the <i>dead</i> bury their dead.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Now if Jesus was in the habit of describing those who
were lost in sin as being “dead,” and of bidding His
disciples “raise the dead”—meaning that they were to
restore sinners to spiritual life—we can easily see how
such language might be misunderstood. It is probable
that Jesus Himself had actually restored life to at least
one person given over for dead, the daughter of Jairus,
though by natural means. Of such revivification you
may find an instance described in <i>Onesimus</i> (pp. 77-81)
which is taken almost verbatim from the account of his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>revivification given by the late Archbishop of Bordeaux to
the late Dean Stanley, and sent me by the Dean as
being taken down from the Archbishop’s lips. If that was
so, how natural for some of the Disciples to attach a
literal meaning to the precept, “raise the dead”! They
would argue thus, “Our Master healed diseases at a word,
so can we; He once raised a child from the dead and
bade us also raise the dead; some of the Disciples therefore
ought to be able to do this.” How natural, under
the circumstances, such a confusion of the material and
the spiritual! Yet I have little doubt that the diseases
which were cured by the Twelve were almost always
“possession,” or paralysis, or nervous diseases. Compare
the different accounts given by the Synoptists of the
instructions of Jesus to the Twelve when He sent them
forth on their first mission:</p>

<p class='c006'>[Transcriber’s Note: The following three quotations were originally printed
side-by-side.]</p>

<p class='c014'>Mark vi. 7.</p>

<p class='c015'>And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and
he gave them authority over the unclean spirits.</p>

<p class='c015'>Matthew x. 1.</p>

<p class='c015'>And he called unto him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean
spirits to cast them out, and to heal all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.</p>

<p class='c015'>Luke ix. 1.</p>

<p class='c015'>And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to
cure diseases.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here you find that the first Gospel (St. Mark’s) makes
mention only of the “authority over unclean spirits,” and
this probably represents the fact. The third account is
an amplification; and the second altogether exaggerates.
Hence, when we read, in the context of the second version
of these instructions, “Heal the sick, <i>raise the dead</i>,
cleanse the lepers, cast out devils; freely ye received
freely give” (Matthew x. 8), we cannot fail to see several
arguments against the probability of the italicized words
being literally intended by Jesus. First, the language of
Christ habitually dealt in metaphor, and in metaphor
habitually misunderstood by His disciples; secondly, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>is no instance in which a single one of the Twelve carried
out this precept during the life of their Master, and only
one in which one of the Twelve (Peter) is said to have raised
a woman from the dead (for St. Paul’s incident with
Eutychus can hardly be called a case in point); thirdly
the precept is recorded by only one Evangelist;<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c010'><sup>[21]</sup></a> fourthly
that same Evangelist records only one case in which our
Lord Himself raised any one from the dead, <i>i.e.</i> the
revivified daughter of Jairus—and it seems absurd to
represent Christ as commanding all the Apostles to do
that which most of them probably never did, and He
Himself (according to the First Gospel) only did once.</p>

<p class='c006'>We pass now to another cause that may have originated
miraculous narratives in the Gospels. Try to extricate
yourself from our Western, cold-blooded, analytical, and
critical way of looking at things. Sit down in the reign
of Vespasian or Domitian in the midst of a congregation
of Jewish and Græco-Oriental brethren, assembled
for a sacred service, “singing a hymn” (as Pliny says,
describing them a few years afterwards) “to Christ as to
a God.” What effect on the traditions of Christ’s life and
works would be produced by these “hymns and spiritual
songs” which St. Paul’s testimony (as well as Pliny’s)
shows to have been a common part of the earliest
Christian ritual? Would they not inevitably tend, by
poetic hyperbole and metaphor, to build up fresh traditions
which, when literally interpreted, would—like the
songs and psalms of the Chosen People—give rise to
miraculous narratives? Part of the service indeed would
not consist of hymns but of the reading of the “Scriptures”
<i>i.e.</i> the Old Testament; but this also would tend in the
same direction. For there you would hear, read out to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the congregation, marvellous prophecies how, in the day
of the Lord the Redeemer, the eyes of the blind should be
opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped, and the lame
should leap as a hart; and the sole thought possessing
you and every man in the congregation would be, “How
far did all these things find fulfilment in the Lord Jesus
Christ?” You would hear from the “Scriptures” narratives
of marvellous miracles, how Moses gave water from
the rock to Israel in the wilderness and fed them with
food from Heaven, how Elijah raised the widow’s child
from death, and how Jonah spent three days in the belly
of the fish; and the sole thought possessing you would be,
“How far were like wonders wrought by Christ?” Then
would arise the hymn describing, in imagery borrowed
from the Old Testament, how Christ <i>had</i> done all these
things, and more besides, for the spiritual Israel; how He
had spread a table for His people in the wilderness, and
given to thousands to partake of His body and His blood;
how Moses had merely given water to the people, but
Jesus had changed the water of the Jews (<i>i.e.</i> the Law)
into the wine which flowed from His side; how Jesus had
fulfilled the predictions of the prophets by curing the halt,
the maimed, the blind, the leper, the deaf; how He had
even raised the dead and bidden His disciples to raise the
dead; how He, like Jonah, had spent three days in the
darkness of the grave. If you look at the earliest
Christian paintings you will find that they represent
Christ as the Fish (the emblem of food); others depict the
Mosaic miracles of the manna and the water from the
rock. These shew what a hold the notion of the miraculous
food had taken on the mind of the earliest believers.
How easy it would be to amplify a metaphor derived from
the Eucharistic feeding on the Bread of Life and perhaps
on the “honey-sweet fish” (as Christ is actually called in a
poem written about the middle of the second century)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>into a miraculous account of the feeding of many
thousands upon material bread and material fish! It is
greatly to be regretted that we have not one left out of
the many hymns and psalms of which St. Paul and Pliny
make mention. The only vestige of one that I know is
found in a verse of St. Paul’s Epistle to the Ephesians.
It is at all events printed by Westcott and Hort as poetry,
and it is thought by many commentators to be an extract
from some well-known hymn (Eph. v. 14):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Wherefore (he) saith,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Awake thou that sleepest</div>
      <div class='line in6'>And arise from the dead</div>
      <div class='line in12'>And Christ shall shine upon thee.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>This perhaps is our only specimen of the earliest Christian
hymnals. Surely then it is noticeable that in three
lines of this unique specimen there are three metaphors,
and in the second line a metaphorical use of the
word “dead” which—as I have pointed out above—has
probably elsewhere resulted in serious misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the hymn would come the sermon. The preacher
would stand up like Apollos to “prove from the Scriptures,”
that is, from the Old Testament, that Jesus is the Christ.
If you wish to know how some of the Christian Preachers
would probably discharge their task you should look at
the Dialogue with Trypho written (about a hundred years
after Apollos) by Justin Martyr—who, I take it, was very
much superior in judgment, learning, and ability, to the
great mass of Christian Preachers in the first and second
centuries. There—among many other instances of the
adaptation of history to preconception—you will find Justin
declaring that Jesus was born in a cave, and that the ass on
which He rode into Jerusalem was tied to a vine, simply
because certain prophecies of Isaiah mention a cave and a
vine, and because he is determined to find fulfilments of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>them in the life of Christ. But in the early times of Apollos,
and during the next twenty or thirty years, before the
Gospels had been committed to writing, there must have
been a far stronger gravitation towards the Old Testament
and a far more powerful tendency to find something in
the life of Christ to fulfil every prediction about the
Messiah and to correspond to every miracle wrought by
Moses and the prophets. Judged in the light of these
considerations, our present record of Christ’s life ought
to surprise us not by the number, but by the paucity, of
the fulfilments of prophecy and the miracles contained
in them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Against these arguments for the antecedent probability
that miracles would be baselessly imputed to Jesus (to be
followed presently by a few instances to shew that they
have been so imputed) I know nothing that has been recently
urged except a consideration drawn from the life of
John the Baptist: “To the Baptist no miracle has been
imputed by the Gospels; to Christ miracles have been
imputed; why not to both? What is the reason for this
distinction except that the former did not perform
miracles, while the latter did?” Two reasons can be
given. In the first place Christ worked “mighty works,”
while John did not; and since many of these “mighty
works” could not in the first century be distinguished from
“miracles,” they served as a nucleus round which a
miraculous narrative might gather; in the history of the
Baptist there would be no such nucleus. The second and
perhaps more important reason is, that, as a counterpoise
to the natural exaggerative tendency which might
have led men to attribute miracles to the Baptist, there
would be also a tendency to heighten the contrast between
the Servant and the Master. This tendency appears to
me to increase in the later Gospels till at last in the Fourth
we come to the express statement, “John worked no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>miracle” (John x. 41). But whether I am right or not in
this conjecture, it is quite certain that the attitude of the
Christians towards the mere forerunner of the Messiah—about
whom the Prophets had simply predicted that he
would “turn the hearts of the children to the fathers”—would
not be such as to render likely any imputations of
miracles to him. At Ephesus, in the days of St. Paul,
there were some quasi-Christians who had received none
but “John’s Baptism,” and had “not so much as heard
whether there is a Holy Ghost.” That gives us a much
stronger impression of the Prophet’s influence, and a
much weaker impression of the prevalence of the doctrine
about the Holy Spirit in the earliest Christian teaching,
than we should have inferred from what we read in the
Fourth Gospel: was it likely, when the Baptist’s influence
seemed to the contemporaries of St. Paul still so powerful
(perhaps too powerful) that they would be tempted
unconsciously to magnify it by casting round him that
halo of miraculous action which naturally gathered around
the life of Christ?</p>

<p class='c006'>Does it seem to you very hard, and almost cruelly unnatural,
that the life of the Baptist—in whom the world
takes comparatively little interest—should be handed
down with historical accuracy (at least so far as miracles
are concerned) while the life of Christ, the centre of the
hopes and fears of the civilized world, has been permitted
by Providence to become a nucleus for illusion and superstition
as well as for the righteous faith and love of
mankind? It is hard; it is not unnatural.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When beggars die there are no comets seen;</div>
      <div class='line'>The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>What does Shakespeare mean by this except to exemplify
the universal, and natural, but illusive belief, that
whatever affects the greatest man must also affect material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>nature? Therefore in proportion to the greatness of any
man we must expect that the illusions about him will be
great in the minds of posterity. How indeed could it be
otherwise? Reflect for a moment. Jesus came into the
world to be a spiritual Saviour, a spiritual Judge; but how
few there were in those days who could fully appreciate
even the meaning of these titles! Do you yourself, even
at this date, after the lapse of eighteen centuries, grasp
firmly this notion of spiritual judgment? Reverence can
hardly restrain you from smiling at the Apostles for their
unspiritual dreams of a “carnal” empire with twelve
tangible thrones to be set up for their twelve selves in
Palestine; but you yourself, have you never, at all events
in younger days, dreamed sometimes of a visible white
throne on material clouds, of a visible and perhaps
tangible trumpet, of an audible verdict of “Guilty” or
“Not guilty” externally pronounced on each soul? perhaps
also of palpable palm branches, and of I know not
what more sensuous apparatus, without which you can
scarcely realize the notion of the Day of Judgment? And yet
all these are adventitious and accidental accompaniments
of the real and essential “judgment” which is in Greek
the “sifting” or “division” <i>i.e.</i> the division between good
and evil in the heart of each one of us. But I doubt even
now whether you understand the meaning of this spiritual
“division” or judgment. Let me try to explain it. Have
you not at any time suddenly, in a flash, been brought face
to face with some revelation of goodness, some good
person, or action, or book, or word, or thoughts—which in
a moment, before you were aware, has lighted up all the
black caverns of your nature and made your mind’s eye
realize them, and your conscience abhor them, setting your
higher nature against your lower nature, so that, without
your knowing it, this angelic visitant has taken hold of
you, carried away the better part of you along with itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>into higher regions of purer thought than yours, from
whence your better nature is forced to look down upon,
and condemn, your lower and grosser self? This “division”
is the operation of the two-edged sword of the
Spirit; and when a man’s cheeks flush with shame, or his
heart feels crushed with remorse, under this “dividing”
power, and he <i>feels</i> the verdict “I am guilty,” then he is
being judged far more effectually than any earthly law
court could judge him. Now it is this kind of judgment
that Jesus had in mind when He spoke of the judgment
of the world by the Son of Man. In this sense He has
been judging, is judging, and will judge, till the Great
Judgment consummates the story of such things as are to
be judged. But how little has the world realized this!</p>

<p class='c006'>Probably some would have realized less of the spiritual if
they had imagined less of the material. You know how
the English judges of our times still insist on much of the
old pomp and ceremony which in the days of our forefathers
was thought necessary in order to make justice
venerable. The trumpets, and the javelin-men, and the
sheriffs in the procession, the wig and gown and bands
in court—they all seem a little ridiculous to most of us
now; yet possibly the judges are right in retaining them.
Possibly our brutal English nature will need for some
decades longer these antique and now meaningless
trappings before they will be able to respect the just judge
for the sake of justice itself. And in the same way, from
the days of Clovis to those of Napoleon, many a man
who would have found it impossible to realize the righteous
Judge as the invisible wielder of the two-edged sword of
the Spirit, has felt a fear, which perhaps did more good
than harm, at the thought of the opening graves, the
unclothed trembling dead, the thunder-pealing verdict
and the flames of a material hell. Who also can deny
that the illusion which has represented Jesus as having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>possessed and exerted the power to cure every imaginable
disease of the body, has led many to realize Him as the
Healer of something more than material disease, in a
manner otherwise impossible for masses of men living
under an oppression which often scarcely left them the
consciousness that they possessed anything but bodies
wherewith to serve their masters?</p>

<p class='c006'>Do not suppose, because I am forced by evidence to
reject the miracles, that I am blind to the part that they
once played in facilitating faith in Christ. A whole essay,
a volume of essays might be written on that subject, without
fear of exaggeration. The Miraculous Conception,
the Miraculous Resurrection and Ascension, the miracles
of the feeding of the four thousand and of the five thousand,—it
would be quite possible to shew from Christian
literature and history, how in times gone by, when laws
of nature were unrecognized, these supposed incidents of
Christ’s life not only found their way into men’s minds
without hesitation and without a strain upon intellect or
conscience, but also conveyed to the human heart, each in
its own way, some deep spiritual truth satisfying some
deep spiritual need. It is the old lesson once more
repeated: the eyes take in, as a picture, what the ears
fail to convey to the brain or heart, when expressed in
mere words.</p>

<p class='c006'>But now, there are abundant symptoms that the tempers
and minds of men are greatly changed. Men’s minds
are more open than before to the need of some spiritual
bond to keep society together; and the character and
spiritual claims of Christ, and the marvellous results that
have followed from His life and death, are beginning (I
think) to be recognized with more spontaneousness and
with less of superstitious formalism. On the other hand,
the vast regularity of Nature has so come home to our
hearts that some believe in it as if it had a divine sanctity;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>the thought of praying that the sun or moon may stand
still shocks us as a profanity; and boys and girls, as
they stand opposite to some picture setting forth a Bible
miracle, look puzzled and perplexed, or, if they are a little
older, say with a sententious smile that “the age of
miracles is past.” In a word, that very element of inexplicable
wonder which once strengthened the faith, now
weakens it, by furnishing weapons to its assailants, and
by inducing rash believers to take up and defend against
sceptics a position that is indefensible.</p>

<p class='c006'>In any case, it is the duty of each generation of
Christians to put aside, as far as it can, the illusions of the
previous generation and to rise higher to the fuller knowledge
of Christ; for the outworn and undiscarded illusions
of one generation become the hypocrisies of the
next. The illusions of the permanence of the Mosaic
Law, of the speedy Consummation, of Transubstantiation,
of the Infallible Church, of the Infallible Book, have
all been in due course put away. A candid and modest
Christian ought surely to argue that, where so many
illusions have already been discarded—and all without
injury to the worship of Christ—some may remain
to be discarded still, and equally without injury to the
Eternal Truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>What if miraculous Christianity is to natural Christianity
as the Ptolemaic astronomy is to the Newtonian? Both
of these astronomical systems were of practical utility;
both could predict eclipses; both revealed God as a God
of order. But the former imputed to the unmoving sun
the terrestrial motion which the latter correctly imputed
to the earth; the former explained by a number of arbitrary,
non-natural, and quasi-miraculous suppositions—spheres,
and spirals, and epicycles, and the like—phenomena which
the latter more simply explained by one celestial curve
traced out in accordance with one fixed law. I believe that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>in religion also we have made a similar mistake and are
being prepared for a similar correction. We have imputed
to Christ some actions which have sprung from the
promptings of our own imaginations—imaging forth what
<i>our</i> ideal Deliverer would have done—and which have
represented, not His motions, but the motions of our own
hearts. By what we have euphemistically denominated
“latent laws,” that is to say by hypotheses as arbitrary
and baseless as the old epicycles, unsupported by sufficient
evidence and inconsistent with all that we see and hear and
feel around us in God’s world, we have endeavoured to
explain a Redemption which no more needs such explanations
than forgiveness needs them—a Redemption which is
as natural (that is to say, as much in accordance with the
laws of physical nature and the ordinary processes of
human nature) as that Law of Love, or Spiritual gravitation,
which may be illustrated in the microcosm of every human
household. Now we are to learn the new truth: and as
the God of Newton is greater (is He not?) than the God
of Ptolemy, so let us not doubt that the God revealed
in spiritual Christianity will be greater than the God
revealed in material and miraculous Christianity. The
new heavens will not cease to declare the glory of God;
the new firmament will not fail to tell of His handiwork.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>
  <h2 id='let18' class='c004'>XVIII <br /> ARE THE MIRACLES INSEPARABLE FROM THE LIFE OF CHRIST?</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>From the digressions concerning the growth of the
Gospels and the possibility or probability that their truths
would be conveyed through illusion I now return to our
main subject, the question whether the life of Christ can
be disentangled from miracles. And here you tell me
that some of your agnostic and sceptical friends quote
with great satisfaction the following sentence from Bishop
Temple’s recent <i>Bampton Lectures</i><a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a>: “Many of our
Lord’s most characteristic sayings are so associated with
narratives of miracles that the two cannot be torn apart.”
I can well believe what you tell me as to the advantage
which they naturally take of this admission: “Here,”
they say, “is a statement made on high authority that,
unless you can believe that Jesus worked <i>bonâ fide</i> miracles,
such as the blasting of the fig tree and the destruction
of the swine, you must give up ‘many of Christ’s most
characteristic sayings’ in other words, you must give up
the hope of knowing what Jesus taught.” I wish your
friends, who quote this assertion with so much pleasure,
would also have quoted the “characteristic sayings”
alleged by Dr. Temple in proof of this assertion; for
you would then have seen for yourself that many of
these “characteristic sayings” are associated not with
“miracles” but with “mighty works;” and I am sure you
have not forgotten the difference between the two.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>For example the first of the “characteristic sayings”
is, “Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.” Now these words
were spoken to the paralytic man; and, as we have seen
above, the cure of paralysis by appeal to the emotions—although
a remarkable act, and although, if permanent,
so remarkable as to deserve to be called “a mighty work”—cannot
be called a miracle. But I need say no more
of this, as I have treated of cures by “emotional shock”
in a previous letter. Now all the other sayings quoted by
Dr. Temple refer to “faith” or “believing;” and all, I
think, are connected with acts of healing. There may be
doubtless in some of our present accounts of the “mighty
works” some inaccuracies or exaggerations as to the
nature of the disease and the circumstances of the cure.
For example, when the cure is said to have been performed
at a distance from the patient, either (1) faith must have
wrought in the patient by his knowledge that his friends
were interceding with Christ, or (2) we must assume
some very doubtful theory of “brain-wave” sympathy, or
admit that (3) the story is exaggerated, or else that (4)
there is a <i>bonâ fide</i> miracle. For my own part I waver,
in such cases as that of the centurion’s servant and the
Syro-Phœnician’s daughter, between the hypotheses which
I have numbered (1) and (3), with a sentimental reserve
in favour of (2); but any one of these seems to me so far
more probable than the hypothesis of a suspension of the
laws of nature that I do not feel in the least constrained
by reason of such “characteristic sayings” concerning
faith, to give in my adhesion to a narrative of miracle.
On the contrary I say the mention of “faith,” and Christ’s
“marvel” at faith, and His eulogy of the “greatness” of
the “faith” in certain cases, all go to prove that these acts
were not miracles, but simply acts of faith-healing on a
colossal scale. I hope you will not feel inclined to sneer
at the reservation in those last four words. You will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>surely admit that, if Christ did anything naturally, the
result might be proportionate to His nature; and if His
power of appealing to the emotions was colossal, the
material result of that appeal might be proportionately
colossal. I begin, therefore, the process of disentanglement
between the historical and the miraculous in Christ’s
life by a protest against a hasty and blind confusion which
refuses to discriminate between “miracles” and “mighty
works,” and calls on us to reject from the history not only
the miraculous but the marvellous as well; and I assert
that the acts of faith healing with which, as Bishop Temple
truly says, there are associated many of our Lord’s most
characteristic sayings, may be accepted as generally
historical and natural.</p>

<p class='c006'>This, however, would not apply to such a miracle as the
restoration of the ear of the high priest’s servant; and the
reasons are obvious. The faith necessary for an act of
emotional healing is not said to have existed, and is not
likely to have existed, in a man who probably looked on
Christ as an impostor. Even if it had existed, the case
was not one where we have reason to think faith could
have healed. Besides, the miracle is omitted by three out
of the four Evangelists. It is possibly a mistaken inference
from some tradition about an utterance of Jesus,
“Suffer ye thus far;” which may have really had an entirely
different meaning, but which led the third Evangelist to
conclude that Jesus desired His captors to give Him so
much liberty as would allow him to perform this act of
mercy—a humane and picturesque thought, but not history.
It is scarcely conceivable that the other three Evangelists
should have mentioned the wound inflicted on the servant;
that Matthew and John should have added a rebuke
addressed by Jesus to Peter for inflicting it; and that John
should have taken the pains to tell us the name of the
high priest’s servant and yet that they should have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>omitted, if they actually knew, the fact that the wound
was immediately and miraculously healed by Jesus. The
irresistible conclusion is that St. Mark, St. Matthew, and
St. John, knew nothing of this miracle.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the acts of healing are set apart, and considered
as “mighty works” but not “miracles,” the <i>bonâ fide</i>
miracles in the Synoptic Gospels will become few indeed:
and I think it will be found that these few are susceptible
of explanation on natural grounds. We will pass over
the finding of the coin in the fish’s mouth which is found
in St. Matthew’s Gospel alone and can hardly be associated
with any “characteristic saying” of Jesus—and
come to a miracle common to the three Synoptists,
the destruction of two thousand swine following on the
exorcism of the Gadarene.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a very curious case of misunderstanding arising
from literalism. It was a common belief in Palestine
(as it was also in Europe during the middle ages), that
the bodies of the “possessed,” or insane, were tenanted
by familiar demons in various shapes—toads, scorpions,
swine, serpents, and the like. These demons were supposed
to have as their normal home an “abyss” or
“deep” (Luke viii. 31, ἄβυσσον); but this they abhorred,
and were never so happy as when they found a home in
some human body. The “possessed” believed that these
demons were visible and material; and the juggling
exorcist would sometimes (so Josephus tells us) place a
bucket of water to be overturned by the demons in passing,
as a proof that they were driven out. In a word, the
“possessed” could hardly be convinced that he was
cured, unless he saw, or thought he saw, the frogs,
serpents, scorpions, or swine actually rushing from his
mouth in some definite direction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The explanation of the miracle will now readily suggest
itself to you. Some man, perhaps a patriotic Galilean, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>whom nothing would be more hateful than a Roman
army, conceived himself to be possessed by a whole
“legion,” two thousand “unclean swine.” Identifying
himself—as was the habit of those who were “possessed”—with
the demons whom he supposed to have possession
of him, the insane man declared that his name
was “Legion, for we are many” and they (or he)
besought Jesus that He would not drive them into the
“deep,” <i>i.e.</i> into the “abyss” above-mentioned. But by the
voice of Jesus the man is instantaneously healed: he
sees the legion of demons that had possessed him rushing
forth in the shapes of two thousand swine and hurrying
down into “the deep;” and what he sees, he loudly
proclaims to the bystanders. It is easy to perceive how
on some such a basis of fact there might be built the
tradition that Jesus healed a demoniac whose name
was Legion, and sent two thousand swine into the deep
sea; and from thence by easy stages the tradition might
arrive at its present shape.</p>

<p class='c006'>So far, I think, you do not find it very difficult to
separate the miraculous from the historical in the life of
Christ, nor feel yourself forced to sacrifice any of the
“most characteristic sayings of Jesus.” Let us now come
to a miracle of greater difficulty, the blasting of the
barren fig-tree.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even of those commentators who accept the miracle
of the fig-tree as historical, most, I believe, see in it a
kind of parable. The barren fig-tree, they say, which
made a great show of leaves but bore no fruit, obviously
represents, in the first place, the Pharisees, and in the
second place, the nation, which, as a whole, identified
itself with the Pharisees. Both the Prophets and the
Psalms delight in similar metaphors. Israel is the vine;
Jehovah, in Isaiah, is the Lord of the vine, who demands
good fruit and finds it not, and consequently resolves to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>destroy the vine. So here, the Lord comes to the fig-tree
of Phariseeism, the tree of degenerate Israel, seeking
fruit; and finding none, He curses it, and withers it with
the breath of His mouth. Is it not easy to see how a
parable, thus expressed in the hymns and earliest traditions
of the Church, might speedily be literalized and give
rise to a miraculous narrative?</p>

<p class='c006'>Let me point out to you a curious fact confirmatory of
this view. I dare say you may have noticed that St. Luke,
although he agrees with St. Mark and St. Matthew in the
context of this miracle, omits the miracle itself. Why so?
Is it because he never heard of the miracle? Not quite
so. It is because he had heard of it in a slightly different
form, not as a miracle but as a parable, which he alone
has preserved. St. Luke’s version of the tradition is
that the Lord comes to the barren tree and, finding no
fruit on it, gives orders that it is to be cut down: but the
steward of the farm pleads for a respite; let the ground
be digged and manured, then, if there be no fruit, let it be
cut down. A similar thought, you see, is here expressed
in two different shapes, a miraculous and a non-miraculous;
and it is not difficult to understand how the former
may have been developed from the latter.</p>

<p class='c006'>But I see that your last letter has a remark on this very
miracle, and on the difficulty of rejecting it. “It is associated,”
you say, “with one of the most characteristic
sayings of Jesus: for it is in connection with the withering
of the fig-tree that Jesus says (Matt. xxi. 21), ‘If ye
have faith, ye shall not only do <i>what is done to the fig-tree</i>,
but even if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou
taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done.’”
“Here,” you say, “we have a characteristic saying of
Jesus expressly referring to something done, and done
miraculously.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Would it not have been wise, before making so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>emphatic a statement, to consider how St. Mark, the
earlier of the two narrators of this miracle, sets forth the
comment of Jesus? The comments run thus in the first
two Gospels, and I will add a parallel saying from the
third Gospel, not attached to any miracle:</p>

<p class='c006'>[Transcriber’s Note: The following three quotations were originally printed
side-by-side.]</p>

<p class='c014'>Mark xi. 21-23.</p>

<p class='c015'>And Peter, calling to remembrance, saith unto him, “Rabbi, behold the fig tree which thou
cursedst is withered away.” And Jesus answering saith unto them, “Have faith in God.
Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast
into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he
saith cometh to pass; he shall have it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Matthew xxi. 20-21.</p>

<p class='c015'>And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, “How did the fig tree immediately
wither away?” And Jesus said unto them, “Verify I say unto you, If ye have faith, and
doubt not, ye shall [<i>not only do what is done to the fig tree, but even if ye shall</i>]
say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Luke xvii. 5-6.</p>

<p class='c015'>And the apostles said unto the Lord “Increase our faith.” And the Lord said, “If ye
have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye would say unto this sycamine
tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you.”</p>

<p class='c012'>You see then that the more authoritative (because earlier)
of our two witnesses omits those very words on which you
lay so much stress, the “express reference to something
done, and done miraculously.” And ought not this fact to
make you pause and ask yourself “Am I really to suppose
that the Lord Jesus encouraged His disciples to command
material mountains to be cast into the sea, and material
trees to be destroyed? Did He Himself so habitually
act thus that He could naturally urge His disciples to do
the like? Does it not seem, literally taken, advice contrary
not only to common sense but also to a reverent
appreciation of the law and order of nature?” I would
suggest to you that you might weigh the inherent improbability
of the words in St. Matthew (literally taken), as well
as the external probability—which I will now endeavour to
shew—that the whole passage was metaphorical.</p>

<p class='c006'>We know from St. Paul’s works, as well as from
Rabbinical literature, that “to move mountains” was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>common metaphor to express intellectual or spiritual
ability. St. Paul speaks of faith that would “move
mountains;” and you will find in Lightfoot’s <i>Horae
Hebraicae</i> (ii. p. 285), “There was not such another <i>rooter
up of mountains</i> as Ben Azzai.” Now we know from St.
Luke’s Gospel (xvii. 6), that Jesus used a similar metaphor
of trees, as well as of mountains, to exemplify the power
of faith; and this without any reference to “something
done and done miraculously:” “If ye have <i>faith</i> as a
grain of mustard seed, ye would say unto this sycamine
tree, Be thou <i>rooted up and planted in the sea</i>; and it
would have obeyed.” Planted in the sea! Can you
dream that so preposterous a portent could have been
prayed for by any sane and sober follower of Christ in compliance
with his Master’s suggestion? Bear in mind that
these words in St. Luke’s Gospel were uttered a long time
before the blasting of the fig tree is supposed to have
happened, and at a different place. Does not then a comparison
of this passage with the other two make it probable
that Jesus was in the habit of encouraging His
disciples to be “pluckers up of mountains” and “rooters
up of trees,” not literally but metaphorically, meaning
thereby that they were to attempt and accomplish the
greatest feats of faith?</p>

<p class='c006'>You will, perhaps, be surprised when you find what it
was that Jesus regarded as the greatest feat of faith in the
passage of St. Luke just mentioned. It was a feat of
which we are accustomed to think rather lightly; partly,
perhaps, because we are often contented with the appearance
of it without the reality: it was simply forgiveness.
He had told the disciples they must forgive “till seventy
times seven:” The Apostles, in despair, replied “Increase
our faith:” and then Jesus tells them that if they had but
a germ of living trust, they could become “uprooters of
sycamine trees,” in other words they could perform forgiveness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the greatest feat of faith. But perhaps you will
say, “At all events in St. Mark, the earliest authority for
the miracle of the blasting of the fig-tree, there is no
mention of forgiveness, and nothing that would indicate
that his version of the words of Jesus referred to what you
call ‘the greatest feat of faith,’ <i>i.e.</i> forgiveness.” On the
contrary, you will find that St. Mark, with some apparent
confusion of different thoughts, retains the trace of the
original spiritual signification of the words (Mark xi.
22-25): “Have <i>faith</i> in God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever
shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and
cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart but
shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass, he shall
have it. <i>Therefore</i> I say unto you, All things whatsoever
ye pray and ask for, believe that ye have received them,
and ye shall have them; <i>And whensoever ye stand praying,
forgive, if ye have aught against any one</i>; that your Father
which is in heaven may forgive your trespasses.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I contend that, upon the whole, an impartial critic must
come to the conclusion that neither the miracle, nor the
reference to the miracle, is historical; and that, in all
probability, both the miracle and the reference to it arose
from a misunderstanding, without any intention to deceive.
We must remember that the “short sayings” of the Lord
Jesus—as they are called by some early writer, Justin, I
think—must have caused considerable difficulty to the
compilers of the earliest Gospels in the attempt to arrange
them in order. Pointed, pithy, and brief, pregnant with
meaning, sometimes obscured by metaphor, many of these
sayings, if taken out of their context, were very liable to be
misunderstood. Some compilers might think it best, as the
author of St. Matthew’s Gospel has done in the Sermon on
the Mount, to group a number of these sayings together
without connection; others, as the author of St. Luke’s
Gospel, might object to this arrangement, and might make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>it a main object to set forth these sayings “in order,”
attaching to each its appropriate and explanatory context.
Now to apply this to the particular case of the legend of
the fig-tree. It seems probable that the compilers had
before them two traditions, one, a parable about a barren
fig-tree destroyed by the Lord of the vine-yard because it
bore no fruit; another, a precept about the power of
faith in uprooting a mountain or a tree, <i>i.e.</i> in achieving
the greatest of spiritual tasks, the task of forgiving. St.
Luke interpreted both the parable and the precept
spiritually, and kept the two distinct. St. Mark interpreted
the parable literally and adopted the tradition which
made it refer to an actual destruction of a tree; he also
appended to it the saying on the power of faithful prayer to
work any wonders soever, as being an appropriate comment
on so startling a miracle; but he did not think fit to adapt
the saying to the miracle by any insertion of the word
“tree” (“Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall say unto
this mountain, Be thou taken up” &amp;c.); and he retained
the old connection of the saying with forgiveness.
St. Matthew—of course, when I say St. Matthew, I mean
the unknown authors or compilers of the Gospel called by
his name—is more consistent. He, like St. Mark interprets
the parable literally, and he appends to it the saying on the
power of faithful prayer; but he inserts in the latter an
express reference to the miracle which, according to his
hypothesis, had recently been worked before the eyes of the
Disciples and could hardly therefore fail to be mentioned:
“If ye have faith and doubt not, ye shall [<i>not only do what
is done to the fig-tree, but even if ye shall</i>] say unto this
mountain,” &amp;c. In order to complete the adaptation, he
also omits the words that connect the saying with forgiveness,
and relegates them to the Sermon on the Mount (vi.
14, 15) which he makes the receptacle for all those sayings
of Jesus for which he can find no special time and place.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“All this is shadowy, barely possible, mere conjecture.”
I maintain that conjecture, fairly supported, is enough to
give the finishing blow to all faith in a miracle so different
from Christ’s other “mighty works” as this of the fig-tree.
Before finally and utterly rejecting a story found in
a generally truthful narrative we wish not only to know
that the story is improbable, but also to answer the
question, “How may it have crept into the narrative?”
The above conjecture supplies a fairly probable answer to
that question; and the combined result of the evidence for
the probability of some rational explanation, and against
the probability of the miraculous occurrence, is so great
that I can feel no hesitation in rejecting the miracle of the
fig-tree and in declaring that the “characteristic sayings”
of Jesus about the uprooting of mountains and trees were
never intended to be literally understood.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now, before going further, ask yourself once more,
“What have I lost, so far, by giving up the miracles of
Jesus? Does He sink in my estimation because He did
not blast a fig-tree or destroy two thousand swine, or draw
a fish with a stater in its mouth to the hook of Peter? Or
have I lost a precious and ‘characteristic saying’ of Jesus
because I no longer believe that He really encouraged His
disciples to pray for the uprooting of material mountains
and material trees?” I am quite sure your conscience
must reply that you have hitherto lost nothing. If so, take
courage, and follow on step by step where the argument
leads you.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>
  <h2 id='let19' class='c004'>XIX <br /> THE MIRACLES OF FEEDING</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>You remind me that I have omitted the most
important of all those sayings of Christ which are associated
with miracles—the passage in which he comments
on the feeding of the Four Thousand and on that of the
Five Thousand, as two separate acts, apparently implying
their miraculous nature. I have not forgotten it; but I
reserved it to the last because it is, as you justly say, the
most important and the most difficult of all; but I
believe it to be susceptible of explanation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us first have the facts before us. In the Gospels of
St. Matthew (viii. 15) and St. Mark (xvi. 6) Jesus is
introduced as bidding the Disciples “beware of the leaven
of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod” (or, as
Matthew, “the Sadducees.”) Upon this the disciples, as
usual, interpret the words of Jesus literally; they suppose
that, since they have forgotten to bring bread with them
(for they had but one loaf) their Master wishes to warn
them to beware of leaven during the approaching feast of
Passover or unleavened bread. Hereupon Jesus, in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>to shew them that He was not speaking literally, rebukes
their dull and literalizing minds as follows:—</p>

<p class='c014'>Mark viii. 17-21.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why reason ye because ye have
no bread? Do ye not yet perceive?...
When I brake the five loaves among
the five thousand, how many baskets
full of broken pieces took ye up?”
They say unto him, “Twelve.” “And
when the seven among the four
thousand, how many baskets full of
broken pieces took ye up?” And they
say unto him, “Seven.” And he said
unto them, “Do ye not yet
understand?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Matthew xvi. 8-12.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Why reason ye among yourselves
because ye have no bread? Do ye
not yet perceive neither remember
the five loaves of the five
thousand and how many baskets
took ye up? Neither the seven
loaves of the four thousand
and how many baskets ye took
up? How is it that ye do not
perceive that I spake not to
you concerning bread? But
beware of the leaven of
the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
Then understood they how that
he bade them not beware of the
leaven of bread, but of the
teaching of the Pharisees and
Sadducees.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now before I proceed further I must point out to you
that these words are not found in St. Luke’s Gospel. For
my own part I am disposed to believe them to be genuine,
though not quite in the exact form in which we now
find them. I think St. Luke may have omitted them
because he found some difficulty or obscurity in them; or
because he did not know of them; or perhaps because he
did not know of, or did not accept, the feeding of the Four
Thousand, to which they refer. But suppose we are forced
to give them up as altogether spurious, that is to say, as
not being genuine words of Jesus, though genuine parts of
the first and second Gospels; what is the consequence?
Simply that we shall be reduced to St. Luke’s version of
the words, which is as follows (Luke xii. 1): “Beware ye
of the leaven of the Pharisees which is hypocrisy.” Can
we say that St. Luke has herein omitted words that are essential
to the life of Christ, or that we have lost anything
of the highest importance, or even that we have lost a very
“characteristic saying” of Jesus in omitting the statistical
comparison which St. Luke omits? I think not.</p>

<p class='c006'>But now let us assume that Jesus uttered these words
or something like them. I think you would perceive that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>they could be interpreted metaphorically, if you could only
comprehend how the accounts of the miraculous feeding of
the Four Thousand and of the Five Thousand (obviously
literal as they now stand in our Gospels) could be referred
to as spiritual incidents. In order to answer this question
we must now pass to the narratives of the two miracles
themselves. I suppose even those who accept them
literally would admit that they are emblematic, and that
they represent Jesus, the Bread of Life, giving Himself
for the world. The Fourth Gospel manifests this in the
subsequent discourse where the feeding on the bread and
fishes introduces the subject of the feeding on the flesh
and blood of Christ. The notion that we feed on the
Word of God, first found in Deuteronomy (viii. 3), pervades
all Jewish literature. It is found in Philo (i. 119):
“The soul is nourished not on earthly and corruptible
food, but on the <i>words</i> which Gods rains down out of His
sublime and pure nature which He calls heaven.” It reappears
in the account of our Lord’s temptation, when He
replies to Satan, quoting Deut. viii. 3, “Man shall not
live by bread alone but by every <i>word</i> that proceedeth
out of the mouth of God;” and again (John iv. 32), “I
have <i>meat</i> to eat that ye know not.”</p>

<p class='c006'>On that last occasion the Fourth Gospel tells us that the
disciples actually misunderstood the metaphor and interpreted
it literally; and to this day I dare say many would
give a literal interpretation to the “daily bread” of the Lord’s
prayer; but there can be little doubt that Jesus meant by
“bread” every gift and blessing that constitutes life, and
primarily the spiritual sustenance of the soul. As to the
emblematic use of the “fish,” it cannot be traced to the
Old Testament; but in a very early period of the existence
of the Church, as early as the reign of Vespasian, we find
the Fish in rude paintings representing the Eucharistic
food of the faithful; and it is said that this appellation was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>given to Jesus from the initial letters of the Greek title
I(esous) Ch(ristos) Th(eou) U(ios) S(oter) [Jesus Christ,
Son of God, Saviour] because they made up the Greek
word <i>Ichthus</i>, fish. About the middle of the second
century we find one of the earliest extant Christian poems
describing how the Church everywhere presented to the
faithful, as their food, “the Fish, great and pure, which
the Holy Virgin had caught.” The poet evidently did not
invent this metaphor; it was established, intelligible, and
inherited, at the time when he used it, and must have
been in use much earlier. To speak of “crumbs” metaphorically
may perhaps seem to us a bold metaphor,
but it may be illustrated by the dialogue between Jesus
and the Syro-Phœnician woman: “It is not meet to take
the children’s food and cast it unto dogs:” “Truth, Lord;
yet even the dogs eat of the <i>crumbs</i> which fall from the
master’s table.” Now it was a common-place in the
doctrine of Jesus that every disciple who ministered the
Word or Bread of Life invariably received it back in
ample measure: “Freely ye have received, freely give.”
Give what? Certainly not material bread, but the truth
or bread of life. And again, “Give, and it shall be given
unto you: good measure pressed down and running over
shall <span class='fss'>THEY</span><a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a> give into your bosom.” Again, I ask, give
what? What but the spiritual Bread, which, by the laws
of spiritual nature, cannot be freely given without a yet
more rich return into the giver’s heart? It was this
Bread that Christ ministered to His disciples and bade
them set before the people; it was this Bread which the
disciples found multiplied in their hands so that it sufficed
for all, and they themselves were fed from the crumbs
that fell from the food.</p>

<p class='c006'>In course of time the story of this spiritual banquet
finding its way into Christian hymns and traditions would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>be literalized and amplified with variations. As Moses
“spread a table” for Israel “in the wilderness,” so also,
it would be said, did Jesus of Nazareth when he fed
thousands of His followers on divine Bread. The Fish,
<i>which is not mentioned in our Lord’s dialogue with the
Disciples</i>, might naturally he added to the Bread, in the
narrative, as a Eucharistic emblem. If the Fish had
been mentioned by our Lord in the dialogue under question,
my explanation would at once fall to the ground;
but it is not mentioned; and the only difficulty is in explaining
how Jesus could have spoken metaphorically of
the “seven” as well as the “twelve” baskets. We can understand
the “twelve”—each one of the twelve Apostles
who ministered, receiving a return of spiritual “crumbs”—but
whence the “seven?” Here I can but conjecture.
You know that seven is what is called “a sacred number.”
I find in the Fourth Gospel, xxi. 2-14, a story (evidently
emblematic) of a miraculous meal of bread and fishes in
which “seven” apostles took part. This may have been
based upon some tradition in which seven apostles were
recorded as having taken part in a spiritual Eucharistic
feeding of the multitude. If that was so, it would follow
that in the latter case there would be “seven baskets” of
fragments, as in the former case there were “twelve,” corresponding
to the number of the ministering apostles: and
Jesus, in the dialogue under consideration, would remind
His disciples how on two occasions where the bread of
life was multiplied for the hungry, the twelve Apostles
received the twelve baskets of crumbs, and the seven
received the seven.</p>

<p class='c006'>What is the argument in the words under consideration,
according to your interpretation? I presume you would
take them thus: “Why do you suppose I am talking
about literal bread? Can I not make bread as I please?
Do you not remember my two miracles, and how from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>five loaves for five thousand people there came twelve
baskets of fragments, while from seven loaves for four
thousand people there came seven baskets?<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a> How then
can I (or you while you are with me) be in need of literal
bread?” But this interpretation is open to one serious
objection. It is opposed to the whole tenour of Christ’s
life. Nowhere else in the Gospels do we find that Jesus
used any miraculous power to exempt Himself and His
disciples from hunger. We are even taught that on one
occasion He resisted a prompting to turn stones into
bread, as being a temptation from the Evil One. For
His disciples he might undoubtedly have been willing to
do what He would not do for Himself; but that Jesus
(like Elisha) so habitually used miraculous powers to
shelter His disciples from the inconveniences and hardships
of a wandering life, that he could encourage them to
believe that he would do so on the present occasion, is a
hypothesis quite inconsistent with the Gospel history.
Moreover, plausible although this interpretation may
appear to us—because we are familiar with the literalizing
interpretation of the miracles of the Four Thousand and
Five Thousand—it does not, if I may so say, bring out the
proportion of the sentence. Surely it does not sound logical
to say, “Did I not once supply you with bread for four and
five thousand people (literally)? Why then do you not
understand that I now speak of ‘leaven’ metaphorically?”
Instead of this, should we not rather expect: “Do you not
remember how on two previous occasions ‘bread’ was
used spiritually? Why then do you not understand that
‘leaven’ is here used spiritually?” Now this is what I
believe to have been the original meaning of the words,
if genuine. I believe that Jesus intended to remind the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Disciples how on two previous occasions the multitude
had been fed with the spiritual Bread, the Bread of Life:
“You know that that was what I meant before, when I
spoke of Bread; how is it then that you do not understand
my meaning now when I speak similarly of leaven?”</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not pretend to say that this explanation is completely
satisfactory even to me, much less to claim that it
should completely satisfy others. Some may prefer to
rationalize the miracle as an exaggeration with a substratum
of fact; others may reject the dialogue as a late interpolation.
Yet even then I think the considerations above
alleged—which I have put forward, on the supposition
that the dialogue is genuine—may go a long way toward
shewing how these miraculous stories may have sprung
up without any real basis of miracle, and how, in the
elaboration of these narratives, words that cannot be
accepted as historical may have been attributed to
Jesus <i>without any fraudulent purpose</i>. Although I
am unwilling to admit (and do not feel called upon by
evidence to admit) that the words and doctrine of Jesus
have been seriously modified to suit the miraculous interpolations
of early Christian times, yet of course (on
my hypothesis) some slight occasional modifications
cannot be denied. For example, in the miracle of the
Four Thousand, Jesus is introduced as saying, “How
many loaves have ye?” These words must necessarily
be rejected by any one taking my view of the narrative,
as the addition of some later tradition which, interpreting
a metaphor literally, endeavoured to set forth the literal
fact dramatically as it was supposed to have occurred.
In the same way it is possible that the dialogue now
under consideration may be an amplification of a simple
rebuke from Jesus to the disciples for misunderstanding
His precept as to leaven, the early tradition having run
somewhat after this fashion: “The Lord spread a table
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>for the hungry in the wilderness: He gave them bread
from heaven to eat. The Lord gave food unto the multitude
through the hands of the Twelve; and in their hands
the Bread of Life was multiplied so that a few loaves
satisfied many thousands. Then did the Lord warn His
disciples that they should <i>beware of leaven and feed on
nought save the one true Bread. But they understood not
His words, and remembered not the mighty works of His
hands</i>.” It seems to me quite possible, I say, that the
dialogue under discussion may have arisen from an amplification
of some such words as those above italicized; and
I am somewhat the more inclined to take this view because
St. Mark’s narrative (the earliest) contains a curious little
detail which looks like a trace of some old hymn about
“the one true Bread” <i>i.e.</i> Jesus: “They had not in the
boat with them more than <i>one loaf</i> (Gr. <i>bread</i>).”</p>

<p class='c006'>If these suggested solutions seem improbable, let me once
more remind you that you have to choose between them
and greater improbabilities. Either the miraculous
narrative must be historically true; or it must have been
deliberately fabricated; or it must have sprung into
existence without intention to deceive. As to the improbability
of the first of these solutions, I say nothing, because
you have rejected it. Certainly it would be difficult for a
painter to depict in detail the processes necessitated by
this miracle without producing a grotesque impression: but
on this point I am silent, as it is beside my purpose. It
remains therefore for you to decide whether the theory of
deliberate falsehood, or of the unconscious accretions of
tradition and misunderstanding of metaphor, supplies
the least improbable explanation. For my part, having
regard to the character of Christ’s disciples, the abundant
evidence that they misunderstood the teaching of their
Master, and the frequent instances of miraculous narrative
arising from misunderstanding in other cases, I have no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>hesitation in saying that, in this case also, the hypothesis
of deceit is far more improbable than that of misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='c006'>I had not intended to touch on any other miracle; but
one more can be so briefly discussed that I will not omit
it. I dare say you have anticipated (though you have not
read <i>Onesimus</i><a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a>) that I should explain the “walking on
the waves” and the “stilling of the sea” as narratives
derived from early Christian hymns representing the Son
of God as stilling the storms that threaten the bark of
the Church. Nevertheless you may not have perceived
how easily a historical and authentic tradition of the
deeds and words of Christ would lend itself to amplification
so as to be elaborated into the full miraculous
narrative as we now find it in the Gospels. Well
then, open your Greek Testament at St. Mark’s narrative
(i. 25-27, or Luke iv. 35, 36) of the exorcism of an unclean
spirit. You will there find it stated that Jesus “rebuked
an unclean spirit;” and a somewhat rare word is used to
express the rebuke, “Be thou <i>muzzled</i> (φιμώθητι).” It
is further added that the disciples, in their astonishment,
said to one another “What is this? <i>With authority he
commandeth even the unclean spirits and they obey him.</i>”
Now you know very well that the same Greek word
(πνεῦμα) expresses two totally distinct English words
“spirit” and “wind;” but you may not so well know that
the same ambiguity is found in Hebrew. Look at Psalm
civ. 4 in the Old Version, and you will find “Who maketh
his angels (<i>i.e.</i> messengers) <i>spirits</i>;” but the New Version
gives, more correctly, “Who maketh <i>winds</i> his messengers,”
or, “Who maketh his angels <i>winds</i>.” Now suppose
that in some cases where the above tradition was
circulated in the Church, either in Greek or Aramaic, the
word “unclean” was omitted, as it easily might be for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>brevity. It would follow that, without the change of a
single word, the hearers might interpret the story as
follows: “Jesus <i>rebuked the wind</i>, saying to it, <i>Be thou
muzzled</i>. His disciples marvelled, saying, What is this?
<i>With authority he commandeth even the winds</i> and they
<i>obey</i> him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But you may say perhaps, “Jesus could not use such
an extraordinary phrase as ‘Be thou muzzled,’ in addressing
the wind. To a human being it would be
applicable, or even to a spirit, but not to the wind.”
Well, it certainly would be rather unusual: but turn to
St. Mark iv. 39, and you will there find a passage telling
you how, in a storm at sea, Jesus awoke and “<i>rebuked
the wind</i>” with the words “<i>Be thou muzzled</i> (Φιμώθητι),”
and how the wondering disciples said to one another,
“<i>Who is this that even the wind</i> (Matthew and Luke,
‘the <i>winds</i>’) and sea <i>obey him</i>?” It appears to me by
no means unlikely that we have here two versions of the
same tradition; the one in the earlier chapter of St. Mark
representing the facts; the other in the later chapter
resulting from a misunderstanding of the facts, whence
there sprang up the amplified and beautiful tradition of
the Stilling of the Storm—a story which must have in all
ages commended itself to the Church, and may still
commend itself, by reason of its deep spiritual truth,
but which ought, in this age, to be recognized as in all
probability, not historically true.</p>

<p class='c006'>Neither of the above-mentioned explanations of this
miraculous narrative appears to me by any means certain;
but either seems to me decidedly more likely than that
Jesus so far raised Himself above the conditions of
humanity as to rebuke and check the winds and the seas.
If I interpret the life of Christ aright, He neither did,
nor wished to do, any such thing, and would have
regarded the suggestion to do it as a temptation from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>Satan. I say this with reverence, almost with fear and
trembling, knowing that I must give account of these
words hereafter before Him. But what can a man do
more to shew his homage for the Truth than follow where
the Truth appears to lead?</p>

<p class='c006'>In any case I am sure we cannot rightly understand
the life and mind of Jesus until, by a great effort,
we have divested ourselves of our inveterate and vulgar
belief that He wrought His mighty works as mere
demonstrations of His divine mission, and that He had
power to perform any works whatever, quite regardless of
the laws of nature. Had that been the case, I do not see
how He could have blamed the Pharisees for asking Him
to work a sign in heaven. Why should they not have
asked it, and why should not He have worked it?
Jugglers and impostors were very common in the East;
Galilee and Samaria were thronged with professional
exorcists: in miracles performed on men there was
always the possibility of collusion; any act on earth was
open to suspicion of imposture, but in heaven this was
the general belief—there could be certainty; no mere
magician could work a sign in heaven. “Let but the sun
stand still for half a day, and we will believe,” surely this,
from the demonstration-point-of-view of miracles, was a
very natural request; and if Jesus really had the power of
stopping the sun for half a day, and if He felt that His
wonder-working faculty was given to Him for the mere
purpose of demonstrating His divine power, I cannot
understand how He could have refused, much less rebuked,
the request of the Pharisees.</p>

<p class='c006'>But in truth His mighty works or signs were not wrought
in this deliberate way for the mere purpose of demonstration.
They were the results of an irrepressible pity,
appealing to an instinct of power. He could not see a
demoniac or a paralytic look trustfully upon Him without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>longing to help, and in many cases feeling that it was
God’s will that He should help. To suppose that He cured
all who were brought to Him is absurd, and is contrary
(as we have seen above) to the evidence of the earliest
Evangelist. He had the power of distinguishing between
faith and not faith; had He an equal power of discerning
physiological possibilities from impossibilities? Did a
kind of instinct tell Him that the restoration of a lost limb
was not like the cure of a paralytic, not one of the works
“prepared for Him by His Father?” I do not suppose
that such physiological distinctions were intellectually
known by Christ in His human nature, any more than the
modern discoveries of geology, astronomy, or history.
But experience and some kind of intuition may have
enabled Him to distinguish those cases which He could
heal from those (a far more numerous class) which He
could not. In performing these “mighty works” of healing,
Jesus appears on many occasions to have studiously
avoided that very publicity which—on the theory of their
being intended as demonstrations—ought to have been a
condition of their performance. He takes the patient
apart, or expressly warns him to be silent about his cure—acts
quite inconsistent with the demonstration-hypothesis.
Probably He felt that these works, although they came to
Him fresh from His Father’s hands, were not without a
danger. Men crowded round Him, not to hear the truth
but to see “the miracles.” Instead of recognizing that He
did only such works as “the Father had prepared for Him
to do,” they thought that He could do “anything He
pleased.” I think we ought to feel that the very notion of
such a power as this was absolutely revolting to Jesus:
“To stop the sun, to call down fire or bread from heaven, to
stay the course of rivers, and cast down the walls of cities—doubtless
Joshua and Elijah had done these works;
but they were not the works that the Father had prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>for the Son to do.” Joshua and Elijah were but servants.
He was the Son: and, being the Son, He felt bound to
conform Himself each moment to that heavenly Will
which He ever felt within Him and saw before Him,
which dictated “mighty works” indeed, but always works
of love and healing. In one sense He was entirely free;
He could do all things because all things were possible
with the Father, and the Father and He were one; in
another sense He felt Himself less free than any being
that had ever assumed the shape of man, because all
other human creatures had deviated, but He alone could
never deviate, no, not by a hair’s breadth, from the
indwelling Will of the Father.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is for these reasons then that I reject miracles, not
because they are impossible, not even because they are
<i>a priori</i> improbable, not because they were once useless
and are now harmful; but because the facts are against
them. If the evidence shewed that miracles had actually
occurred, I should be prepared to learn from these
materialized parables as reverently as from word-parables,
and to believe that God—in order to break down men’s
excessive faith in the machine-like order of the visible
world, and in order to divert their attention from Sequence
to Will—fore-ordained these divergences from the monotonous
routine of things. But the evidence does not shew
this. The criticism of the Old Testament, and the
criticism of the New Testament, and the researches of
science, and the closer study of the life of Christ Himself,
all converge to this conclusion—that Christ conquered
the world, not by working miracles, but by living such a
life and dying such a death as might be lived and died by
the Son of God, incarnate as a Son of man, and self-subjected
to all the physical limitations of humanity; and by
bequeathing to mankind, after His death, such a Spirit as
was correspondent to His own nature.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>
  <h2 id='let20' class='c004'>XX <br /> THE MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>You wish to draw my attention to the Resurrection
of Christ. “That,” you say, “is either miraculous or
nothing. The arguments by which you appear to be
driving miracles into non-existence—expelling them first
from profane history, then from the Old Testament, then
step by step from every part of the New—cannot make a
stand at your convenience, so as to except the Resurrection.
Yet even St. Paul makes the Resurrection of Jesus
the basis of his own belief and Gospel. If, therefore, that
final miracle falls to the ground, the Pauline Gospel falls
with it: and to that downfall I fear your arguments all
tend, although you yourself do not see it or wish it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I entirely deny the quiet assumption of your first sentence;
which, as it stands (but I am sure you cannot mean
it), affirms that the Resurrection of Christ “is either
miraculous or nothing.” I assert, without fear of contradiction,
that if the phenomena which convinced the
earliest disciples and St. Paul of the reality of the
Resurrection of Christ, were not miraculous but natural,
they constitute the most wonderful event in the history of
the world. But what you wish to say, I suspect, is this:
“By the Resurrection of Christ I mean the Resurrection
of the body; now if Christ’s body was raised again,
the act must have been miraculous.” But how if the
Resurrection was spiritual? St. Paul himself speaks of
a “spiritual body,” not a material body, as rising in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Resurrection. Do you suppose that a “spiritual body”
can be touched? Or that St. Paul could have touched the
presence that appeared to him when he heard the words,
“Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” Now if the
Resurrection of Christ was spiritual and not material,
there may have been no suspension at all of the laws of
material nature, but simply a real, spiritual fact, manifested
to the world according to certain laws by which
spiritual facts are manifested to the senses.</p>

<p class='c006'>But this theory, you will reply, although possibly consistent
with the Pauline narrative, is inconsistent with the
Gospel accounts of the Resurrection. It certainly is. But
it is quite certain—however unprepared you may possibly
be for the statement—that the Gospel accounts of the
Resurrection, taken altogether, cannot be compared, for
weight, with the Pauline evidence. You know that the
oldest Gospel (St. Mark xvi. 8) terminates (probably
because it was left incomplete) with a vision of angels
who speak of the tomb as empty and of Christ as risen;
but not a word about Christ’s resurrection itself. The next
Gospel in chronological order (St. Matthew’s) mentions
one appearance of Christ to some women, and another to
some disciples in Galilee; but as to the last it is said that
“some doubted.” Not till we come to St. Luke’s Gospel
do we find detailed appearances of Jesus to disciples in or
near Jerusalem, in the course of which Jesus is present at
a meal and offers to eat, as evidence that He is no mere
spirit. In the last Gospel of all (St. John’s) there is added
an appeal to the sense of touch; and in an Appendix to
that Gospel, Jesus is represented as inviting the disciples
to a repast of fish and bread, apparently miraculously
supplied and prepared (“they see a fire of coals there
and fish laid thereon, and bread,” John xxi. 9), which He
distributes to the disciples. Afterwards he holds a long
discourse with them. Similarly long discourses between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>the risen Saviour and the disciples are recorded in the
first chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, which we know
to have been written after the Gospel of St. Luke. You
see how unsatisfactory all this is. The further back
we go, and the nearer to the event, the more meagre
and shadowy does the evidence become. It does not
appear in a form ample and cogent until a period so late
as to throw irresistible doubt upon its truth. How can
we possibly answer the doubter’s natural question, “If
there was this unanswerable evidence of the material
resurrection of Jesus, why was it suppressed for two
generations?” Moreover, some of these later accounts,
which relate the handling of the body of Jesus, or the
presence of Jesus at the breaking of bread, might be
literal misinterpretations of some traditions concerning
visions of Christ accompanying the “handling of the body
of the Lord Jesus” in the Lord’s Supper. It is very
significant that St. Peter—whose allusions in the Acts of
the Apostles to his personal evidence concerning the
Resurrection of Christ are of the briefest kind—is introduced
by St. Luke as mentioning only one definite
kind of manifestation of Jesus; and that is one in which
the Apostles “did <i>eat and drink with him</i> after he rose
from the dead” (Acts x. 41). Lastly, there are traces
of interpolations, or additions, at a very early date in
the post-resurrection chapters of St. Luke, and probably
of St. Matthew and St. John; and in dealing with
the post-resurrection narrative of the life of Christ some
of the earliest Fathers quote passages not found in our
Gospels but agreeing somewhat with the suspected additions
in the third and fourth Gospel. The sum of all is, so
far as my own experience goes, that after a patient and prolonged
study of the evidence, with every desire, and indeed
I may say with an intense anxiety (at one period of my life),
to justify myself in continuing to believe all that I once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>believed, I now rise from the perusal of the last chapters
of the Gospels and the first chapter of the Acts of the
Apostles, with the conviction that <i>something</i> certainly
happened to persuade the Apostles that their Master had
verily risen from the dead, but what that <i>something</i> was,
the evidence, so far as it can he obtained from the Gospels,
does not enable us to determine.</p>

<p class='c006'>But we have not yet touched on the evidence of St. Paul
and to this we now pass. Here at last we stand on firm
ground. Here for the first time we find (in St. Paul’s first
Epistle to the Corinthians xv. 8), the unquestionable
evidence of an eye-witness, probably recorded several
years before the appearance of any Gospel now extant.
No one who is competent to form an opinion on the
question can for a moment doubt St. Paul’s assertion
that Christ “appeared” to him, and that some such appearance
as that recorded thrice in the Acts, converted
him from a persecutor into an apostle of Christianity.
We have just been asking, “What was that unknown
something—possibly some manifestation of Jesus after
death—which inspired the Twelve with the conviction and
the faculties necessary to overcome the world?” Now
we seem to have found the answer. An appearance that
overcame and converted a recalcitrant enemy might well
satisfy and imbue with confidence loving disciples, longing
to believe. Especially might this be the case if Jesus had
predicted, as I believe He did predict, that His work
would not be cut short by death, but that in Him would
be fulfilled the saying of Hosea: “In the third day he
shall raise us up and we shall live in his sight.” Although
these words may have been neglected or not understood
at the time when they were uttered, they may have well
recurred to the minds of the Disciples, after their Master’s
death, with a powerful effect. To urge that the despair of
the Twelve could be a greater obstacle than the vehement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>and bigoted antagonism of Saul, in the way of their
receiving a vision of their beloved Master, is a paradox
so pedantical that it is scarcely worth mentioning. You
cannot have forgotten, too, how St. Paul himself assumes
that the appearances of the Saviour to himself, and to the
original Apostles, were of the same kind and on the same
footing: “He <i>appeared</i> unto Cephas, he <i>appeared</i> unto
James, he <i>appeared</i> unto five hundred brethren ... and
last of all he <i>appeared</i> unto <i>me</i> also.” In the two latest
Gospels these “appearances” have been magnified into
accounts that represented Jesus as possessed of flesh and
bones, as capable of eating, as reclining at a meal, and as
entering into long and familiar discourses: naturally we
ask as to St. Paul’s, the indisputably earliest account of a
manifestation of Christ, what traces it exhibits of similar
distortions and exaggerations? You know the answer.
There are no such traces. The manifestation to St. Paul
is plainly admitted by the accounts in the Acts to be what
is commonly called subjective. The “subjectivity” of
some of the earlier manifestations of Jesus to the disciples
is dimly suggested by some passages in the Gospels which
describe how “some doubted” and others failed to recognize
Him; but it is not merely suggested, it is plainly
expressed, in the accounts of the manifestation to St.
Paul. The Apostle is clearly stated to have seen a
sight and heard words, which other people, his companions,
with the same opportunities for seeing and hearing, did
not see and did not hear. Putting aside some slight discrepancies
in the three accounts given in the Acts<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a>—discrepancies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>easily and naturally explicable, and valuable
as shewing that the accounts have not been arbitrarily
harmonized we may say that this is the substantial
result: the Lord Jesus appeared to St. Paul in what is
called a vision. I myself firmly believe that there was a
spiritual act of Jesus simultaneous with the conveyance
of the manifestation to the brain of the Apostle. But
none the less, however coincident it may have been with
a spiritual reality, if there was no presence of a material
body, the manifestation of Jesus to St. Paul must be placed
in the class of visions: and if it was not seen by others
who had the same physical means of seeing, it must be
called, in some sense, “subjective.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet this vision sufficed for him and for the world. In
the strength of this vision, (followed, no doubt, by subsequent
visions and communings with the Lord Jesus), the
Thirteenth Apostle, the intruder, as he might be called—not
“chosen of men,” like Matthias, not called by Christ
in the flesh did the great work of which you and I, with
millions of others, are now joint inheritors. Think of it;
Is it not a remarkable instance of “men working one
thing while God worketh another” to see the Apostles with
due form and ceremony electing their substitute for the
Traitor to be the solemnly ordained Twelfth Apostle,
henceforth unnamed in Holy Writ and all the while
the Holy Spirit preparing a Thirteenth! And for this
Thirteenth Apostle, who never looked on the face of
Christ, never heard a single word of His doctrine, it has
been reserved to tell us perhaps more about the meaning
of Christ’s teaching and certainly to give us more cogent
proof of His Resurrection than all the other Apostles and
Evangelists put together! Truly the last has been first!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>And in the strength of his proof of Christ’s Resurrection—mere
vision though we may call it—this Thirteenth
Apostle, in the face of persecutions outside the Church,
and discouragements and jealousies inside the Church,
first converted the Roman empire to the Christian faith;
then, fifteen centuries afterwards, reconverted and purified
a large section of the Church from mediæval corruptions;
and now, as I believe, some nineteen centuries afterwards,
is on the point of still further purifying the Church from
antique superstition and from modern materialism!</p>

<p class='c006'>What shall we say of the mighty vision that originated
these stupendous results? Shall we take the view of the
modern scientific young man, and lecture the great Apostle
on the folly of that indiscreet journey to Damascus at
noon-tide, when his nerves were a little over-wrought after
that unpleasant incident of poor Stephen? Shall we
say it was all ophthalmia and indigestion—that flash of
blinding light, those unforgettable words, “Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou me?”—all a mere vision? Is a fact
that changed the destinies of Europe to be put aside with
the epithet “mere”? Would not even a materialist stonemason
recognize that a vision which built St. Peter’s
and St. Paul’s is of some tangible importance? You and
I and your scientific young lecturer—do we not in some
sort owe our existence to this “mere vision,” but for
which the earth might be a chaos of barbarism, England
a forest scantly populated with tattooed bipeds, and our
civilized selves non-existent? Patricidal creatures, let
us not speak lightly of the “mere” author of our own
important being!</p>

<p class='c006'>To my mind the manifestation of the Resurrection of
Christ appears, not as an isolated fact, but as a part, and
the central part, of the great revelation of the immortality
of the soul which has been conveyed by God to man, in
accordance with the laws of human nature, from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>beginning of the creation of the world by the medium of
imaginative Faith. In the same way the laws of astronomy
have been conveyed by God to man, in accordance with
the laws of human nature, from the beginning of the
creation of the world, by the medium of imaginative
Reason. I have shewn in previous letters that Imagination
has been the basis of all that is worth calling
knowledge. To shew the bearing of this on the manifestations
of the Resurrection of Christ shall be the object
of my next letter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>
  <h2 id='let21' class='c004'>XXI <br /> THE RESURRECTION REVEALED</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>You are startled, and well you may be, “at the
notion that the resurrection of Christ has been the mere offspring
of the imagination.” I am quoting your words, but
you have not quoted mine. I never said, nor should I
dream of saying, that the resurrection of Christ was “the
offspring of the imagination,” any more than I should say
that the law of gravitation is “the offspring of the imagination,”
or that light is “the offspring of the eye.” But this
is just an ordinary specimen of the way in which people
whose minds are blocked and choked with prejudice, misunderstand
what is contrary to their preconceptions. You
have made up your mind that the Imagination is a kind
of excrescence on humanity, a faculty independent of the
Creator, and incapable of being made by Him the medium
of revelation; and so you pervert my words to suit your
fancies. But what I said was that Imagination is the basis
of all that is worth calling knowledge, and that, as God
reveals the laws of astronomy through imaginative Reason,
so He has revealed the Resurrection of Christ through
imaginative Faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>Before speaking of the special bearing of the Imagination
upon the manifestation of Christ’s Resurrection, let
me say a word or two on the manner in which our human
environment appears to have been adapted to foster the
growth of this faculty. You will be better prepared to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>expect great things from the Imagination when you
reflect on the great things that have been wrought by
God for its development. You say that you do not understand
the statement in the last paragraph of my last letter,
that the Imagination has been made “the medium of
conveying the revelation of the immortality of the soul,”
and still less do you comprehend how this revelation has
been going on “from the creation of the world,” especially
since, during a large portion of this time, there must
have been no men to receive any revelation at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>I said deliberately “from the creation of the world,”
and not “from the creation of mankind,” because inanimate
creation itself appears to me to bear witness to a
purpose, from the first, that this visible world should help
its future tenants to imagine things invisible. Consider
but one instance, the immense influence of Night upon
the Imagination, and you will perhaps come to the conclusion
that, but for the provision of darkness (“these
orbs of light and shade”), men would never have
been led to a faith in the light of immortality. In the
first place by revealing to us the wonder-striking order
of the infinite stars—which, but for darkness, would have
remained for ever a closed book to men—Night leads us
to dream, or to infer, that there may be other pages still
unturned in the book of Nature’s mysteries, and stimulates
us, however far we may progress in thought, still to press
on to something more beyond; and at the same time,
throwing a temporary veil over all the sights of day, it
persuades us to trust that on the morrow the veil will
be removed, and that in the meantime all things will
continue in their order.</p>

<p class='c006'>Night is aided by sleep and dreams. Slumbering in the
darkness, and bereft of the control of the understanding,
Imagination has reproduced before the mind’s eye the
sights of daylight, blended together without thought of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>fitness, order, time, or place, so as to form quite new combinations
which scarcely any deliberate daytime effort
could have so vividly depicted: and in the long train of
confused visionary images there have sometimes passed
before the mental eye of the mourner or the murderer the
very shapes, and even the voices of the dead, forcing the
slumberer to start up and cry, “They live, they still live;
there is a life beyond the grave.” This trans-sepulchral
existence having been once discerned, the Imagination
has set to work to formulate the laws of it, and to map out
and people its regions, thus causing heaven and hell to
become realities and (in course of time) ancestral traditions,
and almost inherited instincts. Sometimes, Imagination
has come with a special and rarely manifested
force to the aid of a belief in a future life. Not in dreams,
but in wakeful moments, though for the most part by
night, there have appeared before the mind’s eye such
vivid images of the departed, as have convinced not only
the seers of the visions but also their friends—and so, by a
pervasive influence, all but a small minority of the human
race—that something real has been seen, the spirit of the
dead made visible: and to this day, in England, there are
not wanting men of the highest ability, culture, and love
of truth, who busy themselves with serious investigations
into the reality of apparitions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Does this seem to you fanciful? Surely it is the fact
that Night and its phenomena have largely influenced the
spiritual, or superstitious, side of human nature: and if
you admit this to be the fact, the only difference between
us is this, that to you this subtle but universal influence
of Darker Nature on Man appears to have been the
result of chance, whereas I think it came from God. To
you, one half of Time appears to have been allowed by
God to be spiritually barren, set apart for the mere
repairing of the human material machine: I do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>believe that the spiritual making of Man was foreordained
on this “half-time” principle.</p>

<p class='c006'>If however you ask me what amount of truth or reality
there has been in these dreams and visions, I should
reply, as about poetry and prophecy, that some of these
imaginations have represented realities, some unrealities;
but that the total result to which they have led men, the
belief in the immortality of the soul, is a reality. But
when I speak of a “real vision” of a spirit or ghost, I
hope you will not misunderstand me so far as to suppose
that I could mean a material, gas-like (though intangible)
form, occupying so many cubical inches of space. A
spirit, so far as I conceive it, does not occupy space;
nor is it the object of sight, any more than of smell or
touch; it is, to me, of the nature of a thought, only a
thought personified, <i>i.e.</i> a thought capable of loving and
being loved, of hating and being hated. But though it
may not be the object of the senses in the same way in
which external things are, it may be manifested to the
Imagination, <i>i.e.</i> the mind’s eye, in such a way as to produce
the same effect as though it were an external object
seen by the body’s eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every one who loves truth will tread with cautious steps
in this mysterious province of phantasmal existence, and
carefully measure his language, knowing that we are in
a region of illusion, exaggeration, and (sometimes) of
imposture. But there does seem evidence to show that
people (mostly perhaps twins), at a distance from one
another, have in some at present inexplicable manner
influenced one another so that the disease or death or
calamity of one has been simultaneously made known to
the other; and you have probably read of cases, fairly
supported, which would show that a passionate longing on
the part of a dying man to see some distant friend may
create a responsive emotion, if not an actual vision, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>mind of that friend. We are so completely in the dark as
to the originating causes (for physiology tells us nothing
but the instrumental causes) which produce our thoughts,
that I see nothing at all absurd in the notion that every
truthful and vivid conception of one human being in the
mind of another upon earth, arises from some communion
in the spirit-world between the spirits of the two.</p>

<p class='c006'>So much for conjectures as to the possible reality or
possible causes of some classes of apparitions. I do not
often myself set much store on them, except so far as they
are of use in reminding us how wide is the province of
possibility, or how narrow the province of certainty, in
the region of ultimate causation. I lay stress, not upon
any conjectural explanation of ghost phenomena, but upon
the following general considerations, most of which are
of the nature, not of conjectures, but of facts: 1st, man
is what he is, largely in virtue of the Imagination; 2nd,
one half of man’s time and one half of the phenomena
of Nature seem to have no other purpose (so far as man
is concerned) than to stimulate the Imagination; 3rd,
if we suppose that this wonderful world is under the
government of a good God, although opposed by an
inferior Evil, we are led to infer that He has implanted
in us this faculty of Imagination and that the noble aspirations
and beliefs which have been developed by it have
not been unmixed delusions; 4th, among the noblest
of the beliefs thus developed, has been the belief in the
immortality of the soul, which, after being tested by the
faith of many centuries, is at this day cherished by the
majority of civilized mankind; 5th, this belief has proved
its truth, so far as imaginations can prove themselves
true, by working well, <i>i.e.</i> it has raised and ennobled those
who have entertained it, and has made them (on the
whole) morally the better for it; 6th, a part of the training
of the Imagination, intimately connected with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>production of the belief in the immortality of the soul, has
been the development of a power to see mental visions,
with all the vividness of material visions; 7th, among
these visions, some of the most common have been apparitions
of the forms of the dead, and some of the best
authenticated of these have occurred where a strong unfulfilled
desire has possessed the departed in the moment
of dying and where the seer of the apparition has been
bound by close ties to the dead.</p>

<p class='c006'>These are the considerations, mostly facts—you may
dispute some of them, but not all I think—in the light of
which I should endeavour to illustrate the manifestation
of Christ to His disciples after death. To these facts I
merely added the conjecture that possibly there may be
something besides the mere movement of our brains that
produces these images of the departed, something—I
will not say external, for a spirit, if independent of place,
can be neither external to us nor internal—but some act in
the invisible world of spirits corresponding to every apparition
upon the visible world. But I did not pledge myself
to such a theory. I only insisted that the whole revelation
of poetry and religion through the Imagination has been
of such inestimable importance to man that we cannot
put it all aside as false because imaginative; we must
regard it with reverence and be prepared to find that in
the central event of the purest religion of all, the Imagination
has been made the medium of the culminating
revelation of spirit and truth. Indeed, if the spiritual
world is real and near, it is difficult to conceive how God—without
breaking the Laws of Nature and without
unfitting us for life in a world of sense—could better give
us glimpses of an invisible environment, than by causing
it to press in, as it were, upon the Imagination, so that
the mind’s eye, thus stimulated by real invisibilities, may,
for the time, supplant the bodily faculty of sight, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>afterwards leave behind in us a permanent suggestion
that, as there is a material world corresponding to the
bodily eye, so there is a mind’s world corresponding to
the mind’s eye. With this pre-conception I will ask you
to approach the narrative of Christ’s Resurrection as I
shall endeavour to set it forth in my next letter from the
natural point of view.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>
  <h2 id='let22' class='c004'>XXII <br /> THE RESURRECTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>My last letter broke off rather abruptly with a
promise to do my best to set forth hereafter the Resurrection
of Christ as it may be regarded from a natural
point of view.</p>

<p class='c006'>Looking at the facts in this light, we have in the first
place to set before ourselves the short life of One of
whom we must merely say that He was unique in the
goodness and grandeur of His character, and that He
died with the unfulfilled purpose of redeeming mankind
from sin, deserted for the moment by the few disciples
who had adhered to Him almost to the last. He died,
for the time, the most pitiable, the most despair-inspiring
death that the world has ever witnessed, asking in His
last moments why He had been “forsaken” by God. But
His death—pardon me if I deviate for one moment from
material to celestial facts, provided that I never deviate
into miracles—was really the triumph over death, and
His Spirit had in reality (we speak in a metaphor) broken
open the bars of the grave and ascended to the throne of
the Father carrying with Himself the promise of the
ultimate redemption of mankind. This was now to be
revealed to the world as the culminating vision in that
continuous Revelation through the Imagination by which
the minds of men had been led to look beyond this life
to a life that knows no end. Speaking terrestrially, we
must say that the influence of Jesus, love, faith, remorse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>were moulding the hearts of the disciples on earth to
receive the truth; speaking celestially we may say that
Jesus bent down from His throne by the right hand of
God to prepare them for the manifestation of His victory.
What in this crisis exactly befell on earth we shall never
know. The tradition that Jesus appeared on the third
day, or after three days, to His disciples, is so naturally
derived from the prophecy of Hosea “on the third day
he shall raise us up”—a prophecy probably applied by
Jesus to Himself—that we can place no reliance on its
numerical accuracy. Nor do we know exactly where
Jesus first appeared to His disciples. The oldest
tradition<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a> declared that they were to “go to Galilee”
after their Master’s death, and that He had promised to
guide them thither; but a subsequent account interpreted
the words about “Galilee” quite differently.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a> In any
case, before many days had elapsed, to some one disciple,
perhaps to Mary Magdalene—out of whom there had
been cast “seven devils”—it was given to see the Lord
Jesus.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here, by the way, we must note the remarkable prominence
given in all the Gospels to the part played by
women in receiving the first manifestations of Christ’s
Resurrection. Writers who were careful to avoid giving
occasion for unbelief might naturally have desired to give
less prominence to the testimony of highly imaginative
and impressionable witnesses; and indeed St. Paul, in
his brief list of the appearances of Jesus (possibly because
writing as an Apostle who had seen Christ, he desired to
confine himself almost entirely to manifestations witnessed
by Apostles), makes no mention of the appearances to
women: their prominence, therefore, in all the Gospels,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>testifies strongly to the early and universal acceptance of
the tradition that women were the first witnesses to the
risen Saviour. But to resume. The news quickened
the faith even of those disciples who had not seen and
who could not yet believe; and presently apparitions
were seen—a thing almost, though (I believe) not quite,
unique in visions—by several disciples together. Probably
the most frequent occasions for these manifestations
were when they had met together to partake of the body
and blood of their Master; and it was in the moment
of the breaking of the bread that the image of the
Living Bread was flashed before them, appearing in the
form of Jesus giving Himself for them, and uttering words
of blessing, comfort, or exhortation, audible to the ears of
the faithful, who at the same moment were handling His
body and touching the blood which flowed from His side.
At other times he appeared before them with other messages;
to the women he seemed to wave them off as if
deprecating a too close approach, or as if bidding them go
hence and carry the glad tidings to the Apostles; others
He seemed to rebuke for their want of faith; in the sight
of others, His hands, outstretched in the attitude of parting
benediction, seemed to send forth His disciples to
preach His word with promise of His presence; but
how these messages were conveyed, whether by gesture
simply, or by spiritual voice (as in the case of St. Paul),
audible perhaps to one, and by him interpreted to the rest,
or audible to all that were in the same faithful sympathy—these
and other details cannot now be determined.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why did not the adversaries of Christ confront His
followers by producing the body from the tomb, thus disproving
the story that His body had risen from the
dead?” The tomb was probably empty. That is probable
for two reasons, first because the earliest traditions
agree that the women going to the tomb found the stone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>rolled away; and secondly, because the adversaries of
Jesus appear to have themselves subsequently circulated
a story that the disciples had stolen away the body. This
they would hardly have done if they had known that
their own explanation could be at any moment refuted by
opening the tomb, which would have shown the body still
lying there. Possibly some of the enemies of Jesus had
themselves removed the body, influenced by some of those
predictions of Jesus about Himself, which, though they
had not the power to inspire the disciples with faith in the
moment of His death, had power to inspire His enemies
with a vague fear. Being almost surprised in the act, they
may not have had time to replace the great stone at the
entrance of the tomb, when the women arrived; if
so, the action of Christ’s own enemies prepared the way
for the belief in His resurrection by exhibiting to the
sorrowing disciples the stone rolled away and the empty
sepulchre. First came the cry, “He is not here,” and
that prepared the way for “He is risen.”</p>

<p class='c006'>How long the visionary period lasted we cannot tell.
It is almost certain that there were many more visions
than the five recorded by St. Paul (1 Cor. xv. 6, 7). At
least one of St. Paul’s five visions, that to St. James, is
not mentioned in any of our extant Gospels; on the
other hand St. Paul omits some of those peculiar to the
third or fourth Gospels, as well as the manifestations to
the women. Perhaps the visions were so many, and all
so like each other, that the Church found it difficult to
select which to record; and each Evangelist chose those
which appeared to him fittest, either because they were
the earliest, or because the witnesses were numerous, or
because they were apostolic, or because they contained
the most striking proof of a veritable resurrection. We
may therefore easily accept the statement that the period
of visions lasted for forty days or even for a much longer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>time, probably till the disciples felt emboldened to take an
active course in preaching the Gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Concerning Christ’s manifestation to St. Paul I have
said enough in my last letter—if anything needed to be
said—to shew that it must have been of the nature of a
vision, and (in a sense) “subjective.” But it differs from the
rest in that it was made to an enemy while the other
manifestations were made to devoted disciples. Love,
remorse, faith, affection, stimulated the Apostles to cry,
“He cannot have died,” and prepared their souls to see
the image of Jesus risen; but where, it may be asked,
was the spiritual preparation in the heart of St. Paul to
receive such a vision? You may trace it in the words
which St. Paul heard from Jesus: “It is hard for thee
to kick against the pricks.” They shew that the future
Apostle had been struggling, and struggling hard, against
the compunctions of conscience. Being a lover of truth
from his childhood, he was prepared to give up all for its
sake; but recent events had made him ask whether he
was not fighting against the truth instead of for the truth.
He had been persecuting the Christians; but their faith and
patience had made him doubt whether they might not be
right and he wrong. When the first martyr Stephen
looked up to heaven and there saw Jesus seated at the
right hand of God, then or soon afterwards, the question
must have arisen in the mind of the persecutor, “What
if the follower of the Nazarene was speaking truth?
What if the crucified Jesus whom I am now persecuting
was really exalted to God’s throne?” Such was the
struggle through which Saul’s mind was passing when the
Spirit of Jesus, acting indirectly through the constancy
and faith of His persecuted disciples, having first insensibly
permeated and undermined the barriers of Pharisaic
training and education, now swept all obstacles before
it in an instantaneous deluge of conviction that this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>persecuted Jesus was the Messiah. At that same moment
the Messiah Himself (who during these last months and
weeks of spiritual conflict had been bending down closer
and closer to the predestined Apostle from His throne in
heaven) now burst upon the convert’s sight on earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>But I think I hear you saying, “All this sounds well;
but he has repeatedly described these visions of the risen
Saviour as subjective: how then can he call them real?
What is real?” Let me refer you to the paper of
Definitions which I enclosed in a previous letter.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>1. <i>Absolute reality cannot be comprehended by men, and
can only be apprehended as God, or in God, by Faith.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>2. <i>Among objects of sensation, those are (relatively)
real which present similar sensations in similar circumstances.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>Now if you try to regard the manifestation of the
risen Christ under the second head, as an “object of
sensation,” you must pronounce it “unreal,” inasmuch
as it would not “present similar sensations in similar circumstances;”
by which I mean that, with similar opportunities
of observation, different persons (believers, for
example, and unbelievers) would not have derived similar
sensations from it. But your conclusion would be false because
you started from a false premise: these manifestations
cannot be classed “among objects of sensation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The movements of the risen Saviour appear to me to
have been the movements of God; His manifestations to
the faith of the Apostles were divine acts, passing direct
from God to the souls of men. Since therefore these
manifestations belonged to the class of things which “can
only be apprehended as God, or in God, by faith,” I call
them “absolute realities”—as much more real than flesh
and blood, as God Himself is more real than the paper
on which I am now writing.</p>

  <h2 id='let23' class='c004'>XXIII <br /> THE SPIRITUAL RESURRECTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>I am not surprised to hear that you consider the
theory above described of Christ’s resurrection, “vague,
shadowy, and unsatisfying.” But as in the very same
letter you say that you are quite convinced of the unhistorical
nature of the account of the resurrection of
Christ’s material body, I think you ought not to dismiss
the subject without giving more attention than you have
given as yet to it. As a student of history and as a young
man bent on attaining such knowledge as can be attained
concerning the certainties or probabilities that have the
most important bearing on the life and conduct of myriads
of your fellow-creatures, you ought at least to ask yourself
what better explanation you have to offer of the marvellous
phenomena of the Christian Church and in particular of
St. Paul’s part in spreading Christianity.</p>

<p class='c006'>I sympathize with the “sense of bathos,” as you call it,
which comes over you when you hear that the phenomena
of the Resurrection of Christ are to be explained by a
study of the growth and development of the revelation
given to mankind through the Imagination. I sympathize
with you; but I sympathize with you as I should with a
child who might be standing by Elijah’s side at the time
when the prophet saw his never-to-be-forgotten vision.
That child would feel, no doubt, “a sense of bathos”
because the Lord was not in the fire, nor in the whirlwind,
nor in the earthquake, but in the still small voice.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>You are in the childish stage of susceptibility to anything
that is noisy and big; you have not been taught by
experience and thought to appreciate the divineness of
things obvious, ordinary, and quiet; above all you have
not yet learned to revere your own nature nor to acknowledge
(except with your lips) that you are made in the
image of God. Retaining still a keen recollection of the
pain with which I passed through that stage myself, I have
neither the inclination, nor the right, to despise your present
condition of mind; but I believe, if you will still keep
the question open in your mind, and if you will meditate a
little now and then on the frequency, or I may say the
universality, of illusion in the conveyance of all the highest
truth, you will gradually come, as I came, to perceive that
the essence of the resurrection of Christ is that His Spirit
should have really triumphed over death, and not that
His body should have risen from the grave.</p>

<p class='c006'>No doubt you would be much more impressed if the
tangible body of some dead friend of yours, after being
buried in the earth, had appeared to certain witnesses and
touched them, and eaten in their company, than if a vivid
apparition of the friend had appeared to the same witnesses;
but I think you would much more easily believe
the latter than the former; and you might be more impressed
by a strong conviction of the latter than by a
doubtful, timid, clinging to the former. I can hardly think
that if you had received several accounts from independent
witnesses, of apparitions of this kind resulting in a marvellous
change of character in all who had seen them, you
would at once put them aside simply because they might
be called in some sense natural. The very fact of their
being natural would lead you to consider how strange
must have been the causes that had produced such
strange results; how powerful must have been the personality
that had thus forced itself on the mental retina
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>of the seers of the apparition; and if something important
had followed from such a vision, say, for example, the
writing of a great poem, or the foundation of a noble
empire, I cannot think that you would set down the vision
as a negligible trifle.</p>

<p class='c006'>But you feel, I dare say, that, though you might be
impressed by the stories of such an apparition, you could
not feel certain that the apparition represented any reality;
there would be no definite proof that the witnesses of the
apparition were not under the influence of a delusion.
Well, I will admit that there would be no proof of the
ordinary kind, that is to say, no proof such as is conveyed
through the senses about ordinary terrestrial phenomena;
but I think you might feel certain; only it would
be that kind of certainty which is largely bred from Faith
and Hope. And this sort of certainty, and no other,
appears to me that which was intended to be produced by
the Resurrection of Christ. His manifestations were unseen
and unheard save by the eye and ear of Faith. If
the proof of His resurrection had not depended upon Faith,
then the Roman soldiers would have seen His material
body miraculously issuing from the shattered sepulchre,
and the companions of Saul would have both seen Christ
and understood the voice that cried, “Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me?” If we could ascertain exactly the
historical basis for the account in the Fourth Gospel of
Christ’s manifestation to the doubting Thomas we should
probably find—supposing that we were really justified in
treating the account as historical—that there was in
Thomas a strong desire to believe, combined with a
strong sense of the impossibility of attaining adequate
proof. As in the life of Christ, so in the resurrection of
Christ, conviction appears never to have been forced on
any entirely unwilling unbeliever.</p>

<p class='c006'>In order to believe in the resurrection of Christ, it is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>enough to be convinced that the evidence is honest and
genuine, and that the witnesses could not be deceived;
that kind of belief savours of the law-court, and there is
nothing spiritual in it; but the man who truly and spiritually
accepts Christ’s resurrection is he who says to himself
as he reviews the life of Christ and the history of the
Church: “Being what He was, and having done the work
that He has done, this Jesus of Nazareth ought not to
have succumbed to death. If there is any evidence to
shew that the veil of the invisible has been so far thrown
back, be it for a moment, as to shew me Jesus in the
spiritual world still living and triumphant over death,
my conscience opens its arms at once to embrace that
belief.” And there is this advantage in basing your faith
on the spiritual resurrection of Jesus, that you keep the
region of faith distinct from the region of disputable testimony.
If you rest your hopes on the material resurrection,
that is a question of doubtful evidence. Your heart
says, “Oh that it might be true!” Your brain says, “I
cannot honestly say that I think it is true.” Hence a
constant conflict between heart and brain, while you are
forced again and again to ask yourself, “Must I be dishonest
in order that I may persuade myself that I am
happy? And even if I can honestly believe in the material
resurrection to-day, how do I know that some new evidence—the
discovery of some new Gospel for example—may
not overturn my belief to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c006'>But the life and doctrine of Christ, the conversion
and letters of St. Paul, the growth and victories of the
Church, and the present power of Christ’s Spirit are
facts that can never be overthrown; and if you say, “On
the basis of these indisputable facts, considered as a part
of the evolution and training of mankind I rest my hope
and my faith that Jesus has conquered death and still
lives and works among us and for us”—why then you rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>on a basis that cannot be shaken. And surely such a
faith is more strong, more spiritual, more comforting,
yes, and more certain too, than a “knowledge” which
you know in your own heart to be no knowledge! How
long will mankind be content to be ignorant that the
<span class='fss'>HALF</span> which constitutes truth is worth more than the
<span class='fss'>WHOLE</span> which is made up of truth and truth’s integumentary
illusion! How many there are to whom the
saying of old Hesiod is still unmeaning:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Alas thou know’st not, silly soul,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>How much the half exceeds the whole!</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>You cannot obtain, and must not expect to obtain, any
demonstrative proof of the Resurrection of Christ, any
more than you can obtain a demonstrative proof of the
existence of a God: yet you can feel as strong and as
sincere a conviction of the former fact as of the latter.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is curious that St. Paul’s parallel between the Resurrection
of Christ and that of men should be so habitually
overlooked. He assumes, as a matter of course, a similarity,
almost an identity, between the Resurrection of men
and the Resurrection of Christ: “If there is no resurrection
of the dead neither hath Christ been raised,” and again:
“Now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the first
fruits of them that are asleep.” This reasoning holds excellently,
if the Resurrection is to be the same for us as it
was for our Saviour, a spiritual Resurrection, and if the
Resurrection of Christ visibly revealed the universal law
which shall apply to all who are animated by the Spirit
of God. But if Christ’s Resurrection was of a quite
different kind, if it was a bodily stepping out of the tomb
three days after burial, how can this be called the “first
fruits” of the Resurrection of men whose bodies will all
decay and for whom therefore no such stepping out from
the tomb can ever be anticipated? The best, the truest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>the most comforting belief in the end will be found to be
that Jesus was “put to death in the flesh but <i>quickened</i>
(not in the flesh but) <i>in the spirit</i>.”  And as it was with
Him, so we believe it will be with us.</p>

<p class='c006'>But perhaps you will remind me that one of the Creeds
mentions “the Resurrection of the <i>body</i>,” and that St. Paul
anticipates the Resurrection, not of a “spirit,” but of “a
spiritual <i>body</i>;” and you may ask me what I infer from
this. I for my part infer that St. Paul desired to guard
against the notion that the dead lose their identity and
are merged in God or in some other essence; he wished
to convey to his hearers that they would still retain their
individuality, the power of loving and of being loved; possibly
also he wished to suggest a life of continued activity
in the service of God; and in order to express this he
used such language (metaphorical of course) as would
unmistakeably imply that identity would be preserved,
and activity would be possible. But he took care to guard
his language against materialistic misinterpretation by
insisting that the body would be “spiritual” and therefore
invisible to the earthly eye and cognizable only by the
spirit. The new body, he says, is “a building from God,”
“a house not made with hands, <i>eternal</i>;” and he prefaces
this by saying “the things which are seen are temporal,
but the things <i>which are not seen</i> are <i>eternal</i>.” Hereby he
clearly implies that the new body will be “not seen.”
Elsewhere he tells us that “the things prepared by God”
for them that love Him (and of course he includes in these
the “building from God, the house not made with hands”)
are such as eye “<i>hath not seen</i> nor ear heard, nor have
they entered into the heart of man; but God hath revealed
them unto us <i>by the Spirit</i>;” and again, “the
things of God none knoweth <i>save the Spirit of God</i>,”
which has been imparted to the faithful.</p>

<p class='c006'>To speak honestly, I must add that, even if I found St.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Paul had committed himself repeatedly to any theory of
a material or semi-material Resurrection, consonant with
the feelings of his times, I should not have felt bound to
place a belief in a materialistic detail of this kind upon
the same high and authoritative level as the belief in the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, or any other general
and spiritual article of faith. But I find no such materialism
in St. Paul. He appears to me to say consistently,
1st, that Christ’s Resurrection was a type of (“the first
fruits of”) the Resurrection of mankind; 2nd, that in
contrast to the first man Adam, the earthy, who became
a living soul, the last Adam, the heavenly, became a “life-giving
spirit;” 3rd, that, as we have borne the image of
the earthy, so we shall also bear the image of the heavenly;
4th, that the “body” of the faithful after death will
be “spiritual,” just as the Church of God is “a <i>spiritual</i>
house,” and the sacrifices of the saints are “<i>spiritual</i>
sacrifices.” There is no more ground for thinking that
St. Paul supposed that we should hereafter have spiritual
hands, or be spiritual bipeds, than for thinking that he
supposed the sacrifices of the Church to be spiritual
sheep, or the temple of the Church to be composed of
celestial stones. After our Resurrection, we are still to
be conscious of God’s past love, still to rejoice in His
present and never-ending love, still to be capable of
glorifying and serving God, of loving as well as of being
loved—this St. Paul’s theory of the “spiritual body” certainly
implies; and it need not imply more. And what our
Resurrection will be, that Christ’s Resurrection was.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ordinary fancies about the Resurrection teem with
absurdities, and are redeemed from being ridiculous, only
because they all spring from the natural and reasonable
desire that we may hereafter preserve our identity. But
they ought to be suppressed if they create, as I fear they
create, additional difficulties in the way of conceiving,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>and believing in, a future life. I do not wish to scoff at
the popular views; but it is important that those who
adopt the materialistic theory of the Resurrection should
realize the unnecessary and grotesque inconsistencies with
which they obscure the Christian faith. Popular Christianity
appears generally to accept a sensuous paradise,
only excluding what some may deem the coarser senses,
the smell, touch, and taste. But what is the special merit
of the other two senses, hearing and seeing, that they
alone should be allowed places in Paradise? And this
visible, semi-spiritual body upon which the vulgar fancy
so insists—what purpose will it serve? “The purposes
of recognition between friends.” Then it will be like the
old material body of the departed—at what period of his
existence? Shall he be represented as a youth of twenty
or a man of forty, or of fifty, or as a child of ten? And
how as to the body of one who was deformed, maimed, or
hideously misshapen and ugly? “It would be a purified
likeness, summarizing, as it were, every period of life, so
that it would be recognizable, not indeed by our eyes but
by those of spiritual beings.” That is conceivable: but
why all this trouble to obtain a visible body that shall
make recognition difficult, when recognition can be conceived
so much more easily as the result of mere spiritual
communion? Keep by all means the language of the
<i>Apocalypse</i> and of the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i> in order to
describe in poetry the condition of the blessed dead; but
remember that it is the language of poetry; and let every
such use of words be concluded (as with a doxology) by
the thought, “Thus will it be, only far better, infinitely
better; for God is love; and our future communion with
the love of God will be a height of happiness such as no
power of sense can reveal, and only the spirit-guided soul
can faintly apprehend.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But perhaps you will say “You are ready enough to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>attack other people’s notions about the semi-material
resurrection; but you are not equally ready to explain
your own notions about a spiritual resurrection. You
cannot even tell us what a spiritual body is, except that
it has the power of loving and being loved.” Precisely
so; I am quite ignorant. Yet in my knowledge of this
matter I am superior to a very great number of other
theologians. For they think they know, whereas I know
that neither I nor they know. Let me go a little further
in my confession of ignorance and admit that I do not
really possess knowledge about a number of other matters
about which many profess with great glibness to know
everything. I am certain that I exist; but I doubt whether
I can analyse and explain the reasons for my certainty,
and I am quite sure I cannot prove my existence by logic.
If I am pressed for a proof, I should say (as I have stated
in a previous letter) that my belief in my existence was
largely due to the Imagination. <i>Cogito, ergo sum</i>, “I
think, therefore I am,”—if intended as a serious proof,
and if there is any real meaning in the “<i>ergo</i>”—appears
to me to be the most babyish of arguments. I respect the
gigantic intellect of the arguer, but not even a giant can
make ropes of sand; and it needs but a little grammar to
dissolve this reasoning to nothing. “I think” means “I
am one thinking.” In some languages, in Hebrew for
example, you might have no other way of expressing the
proposition than in this form: “I am one thinking.” What
sort of reasoning then is this! “I <i>am</i> one thinking, therefore
I <i>am</i>.” “This <i>is</i> white paper, therefore it <i>is</i>!” Surely
a ridiculous offspring to issue from great logical travail!
And besides, what infinite assumptions are presupposed
in that monosyllable “I”! How do I know that “<i>I</i>
think,” and that it is not the great world-spirit who thinks
in me, as well as rains outside me? Why ought I not to
say “<i>it</i> thinks,” just as I say “<i>it</i> rains”? What do you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>mean by “I”? Tell us what “I” is. And how can the
desperate logician set about telling us what “I” is, without
assuming that his own “I” is, which is equivalent to
assuming “I <i>am</i>”? Surely this is altogether a hopeless
muddle, and we ought to give up reasoning about “I”
and “am;” yes, and I would add not only about “I” and
“am,” but also about a number of other fundamental
conceptions, which are far more profitably assumed as
axioms. For my part, whenever I use the words “mind,”
“matter,” “substance,” “spirit,” “soul,” “intellect,” and
the like, and make any serious statement about them, I
hardly ever do so without a mental reservation, saying to
myself—“but of course there may be no such things
precisely as these, but some other things quite different,
producing the results which we ascribe to these; so that
all these statements may be only proportionately true.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not object to the use of the materialistic language
where it is recognized as metaphor by those who use and
those who hear it; but the mischief is that it is often not
so recognized. Once make yourself the slave of the
popular language about “spirit,” and “substance,” and
what not—and you are in danger of being manacled
intellectually as well as theologically. The popular belief
is that a man’s spirit is inside him, like his qualities;
the latter like peas in a box, the former like gas in a
bladder. Drive a hole through a man’s left side or
the middle of his head, and—out goes the spirit; that
is the common materialistic creed. Now I have a strong
desire to declare that this creed is ridiculously false.
But I will be consistent and simply say that I know
nothing whatever about it. My spirit may possibly be
inside me; but it may possibly be outside me; say at a
point six feet, or six miles, above me; or away in Jupiter,
or Saturn, or down at the earth’s centre; or it may be
incapable of occupying space. What does it matter to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>you or to me, theologically or intellectually, whether that
part of us which we call our “spirit” has its local habitation
inside us, or outside, or in no locality at all? Is it
not enough to recognize that we have powers of acting,
loving, trusting, and believing, and to feel certain that God
intends these powers to be developed and never to perish?
Yet I remember that a friend of mine was shocked, and
almost appalled, when I avowed ignorance as to the
locality of my spirit. He seemed to think I might as
well have no spirit at all, if it could not prove its respectability
by giving its name and address!</p>

<p class='c006'>For my part I am now quite certain of Christ’s spiritual
Resurrection, and in that conviction I am far happier
and far more trustful than when I at first mechanically
accepted upon authority and evidence the belief in the
Resurrection of Christ’s body, and subsequently strove to
retain that belief, against the testimony of my intelligence
and my conscience. I think you also will find, as years
go on, when it becomes your lot to stand by the grave into
which friend after friend is lowered, that a heartfelt conviction
of the spiritual Resurrection of Christ affords more
comfort to you at such moments than your old belief—based
largely upon historical evidence, and brain-felt
rather than heart-felt—in His physical Resurrection.
For the former unites us with Christ, the latter separates
us from Christ. We none of us expect that the material
and tangible bodies of our friends will rise from the dead
in the flesh without “seeing corruption;” but we do trust
that they shall rise as “spiritual bodies” over whom death
shall have no power. This trust is confirmed by the belief
that Christ rose as we trust they shall hereafter rise. If,
therefore, Christ rose a material body from the grave—that
stirs no hope in us. But if, while His body remained
in the grave, His spirit rose triumphant to the throne of
God, then we see a hope indeed that may suit our case and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>give us some gleam of consolation. The bodies of the
dead may lie there and decay; but what of that? Even
so was it with the Saviour: but the spiritual body is independent
of the flesh and shall rise superior to death.</p>

<p class='c006'>Do not imagine that the spiritual body is one whit less
real than the material body; only, as the material body
belongs to the time-world, so the spiritual body belongs
to the eternal world. Each is suited to its own environment,
but each of them is a real body. As to the relation
between the material and the spiritual body we know
nothing, and we need know nothing.</p>

<p class='c006'>When will men learn to be less greedy of shams and
bubbles of pretended material knowledge, and more
earnest and patient in their sober aspirations after
spiritual truth? When will they realize that an unhesitating
faith in a few elementary principles is better
than a tremulous quasi-knowledge of a whole globe of
dogmas?</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>
  <h2 id='let24' class='c004'>XXIV <br /> WHAT IS A SPIRIT?</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>You take me to task for the abrupt termination
of my last letter. I broke off, you say, just when you
thought I was on the point of explaining what I meant
by a spirit: “Surely you have some theory of your own
and are not content with disbelieving other people’s
theories.” Well, I thought I had said before that I am
content to know merely this about a spirit, that it possesses
capabilities for loving and serving God, or other
nobler capabilities corresponding to these. But if you
press me to set up some theory of my own that you may
have the pleasure of pulling it to pieces, I will confess to
you that my nearest conception of a spirit is a personified
virtue. This cannot very well be quite right; any more
than a carpenter can be like a door, or like anything else
that he has constructed. But it is the nearest I can come
to any conception that is not too repulsively material.
And sometimes, when I try to conceive of the causes of
terrestrial thoughts, and emotions, and spiritual movements,
I find myself recurring to the antique notion, hinted
at in one or two passages of the Bible, and I believe
encouraged by some of the old Rabbis, that there are two
worlds; one visible, terrestrial, and material, the other
invisible, celestial, and spiritual; and that whatsoever
takes place down here takes place first (or simultaneously
but causatively) up there; here, the mere outsides of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>things; there, the causes and springs of action; the bodies
down on earth, the spirits up in heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is but a harmless fancy. Let me give you another.
You know—or might know if you would read a little book
recently published called <i>Flatland</i>, and still better, if you
would study a very able and original work by Mr. C. H.
Hinton<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c010'><sup>[31]</sup></a>—that a being of Four Dimensions, if such there
were, could come into our closed rooms without opening
door or window, nay, could even penetrate into, and
inhabit, our bodies; that he could simultaneously see
the insides of all things and the interior of the whole
earth thrown open to his vision: he would also have the
power of making himself visible and invisible at pleasure;
and could address words to us from an invisible
position outside us, or inside our own person. Why then
might not spirits be beings of the Fourth Dimension?
Well, I will tell you why. Although we cannot hope
ever to comprehend what a spirit is—just as we can
never comprehend what God is—yet St. Paul teaches
us that the deep things of the spirit are in some degree
made known to us by our own spirits. Now when
does the spirit seem most active in us? or when do we
seem nearest to the apprehension of “the deep things of
God”? Is it not when we are exercising those virtues
which, as St. Paul says, “abide”—I mean faith, hope and
love? Now there is obviously no connection between
these virtues and the Fourth Dimension. Even if we could
conceive of space of Four Dimensions—which we cannot
do, although we can perhaps describe what some of its
phenomena would be if it existed—we should not be a whit
the better morally or spiritually. It seems to me rather a
moral than an intellectual process, to approximate to the
conception of a spirit: and toward this no knowledge of
Quadridimensional space can guide us.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>What, for example, do we mean when we speak of the
Holy Spirit, and describe Him as the Third Person in the
Trinity? I hope you will not suppose—because I happen
to be a rationalist as regards the historical interpretation
of certain parts of the Bible, or because I have not disguised
my dislike of the formal and quasi-arithmetical
propositions in which the Athanasian creed sets forth the
doctrine of the Trinity—that I reject the teaching of the
New Testament on the nature and functions of the Holy
Spirit. Literary criticism may oblige us to regard the long
discourses on the functions of the Paraclete or Advocate
in the Fourth Gospel as being in the style of the author
and not the language of Christ; but it is difficult to suppose
that the sublime thoughts in those passages are the
mere inventions of a disciple of Jesus; and the characteristic
sayings of Christ in the Synoptic Gospels bear
cogent though terse witness to His acknowledgment of a
Holy Spirit who should “speak” in His disciples, and
“teach” His disciples what to say, when they were
summoned before the bar of princes: “it is not ye that
speak, but the Holy Spirit,” Mark xiii. 11; “it is not ye
that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh
in you,” Matth. x. 20; “the Holy Spirit shall teach you
in that very hour what ye ought to say,” Luke xii. 12. I
need not remind you how large a space “the Spirit”
claims in St. Paul’s Epistles, and especially of the use
which the Apostle makes of the triple combination of the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Even, therefore,
if I could give no explanation of the whole of it, nor so
much as put into words the faint glimpse I may have
gained into the meaning of a part of this doctrine, I should
be inclined to accept the existence of the Holy Spirit on
the authority of Christ or St. Paul, as being a doctrine that
does not enter into the domain of evidence, a conception of
the divine nature from which I might hope to learn much,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>if I would reverently keep it before me and try to apprehend
it. But I seem to have a glimpse of it. That influence
or “idea” of the dead which, as Shakespeare says,
“creeps into our study of imagination,” and which reproduces
all the best and essential characteristics of the
departed—when this has once taken possession of us, do
we not naturally say that we now realize “the spirit” of
the dead, feeling that it guides us for the first time to the
appreciation of his words and deeds? Now as God, the
initial Thought, needed to be revealed to us by means of
the Word of God, so the Word needed to be revealed
to us by means of the Influence of the Word. Or, to
put it more personally, as the Father needed to be revealed
by the Son, so the Son needed to be revealed by
the Spirit. Those who knew Christ merely in the flesh
knew but little of Him, and had little understanding of His
words. It was the Spirit of Christ that guided, and still
guides, His disciples into the fuller knowledge of the
meaning of His past life on earth and His present
purposes in heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>I own, however, that I have sometimes felt at a loss
when I have asked myself, “How is this Spirit a Person?
And do I love Him or It? And if Jesus and the Spirit of
Jesus are two Persons, then must I also infer two personalities
for myself, one for my mortal terrestrial
humanity, another for my immortal celestial spirit?”
These questions are extremely difficult for me to answer
with confidence: yet I feel instinctively that they have a
profound and satisfying answer to which I have not yet
attained; but I suggest some answer of this kind, “When
we endeavour to form a conception of God we ought to
put aside the limitations of human individuality. Now we
cannot do this while we conceive of God simply as the
Father, and still less while we conceive of Him simply as
the Son; but we can do it when we conceive of Him as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>being an all-pervasive Power, the source of order and
harmony and light, sometimes as a Breath breathing life
into all things good and beautiful, sometimes as a Bond,
or Law, linking or attracting together all things material
and spiritual so as to make up the Kosmos or Order of
the Universe. The traditions of the Church have taught
us that there has been such a Power, subsisting from the
first with the Father and the Eternal Son, in whom the
Father and the Son were, and are, united; and by whom
the whole human race is bound together in brotherhood
to one another and in sonship to the Eternal Father.
What is this Being but the Personification of that Power
which, in the material world, we call Attraction and in the
immaterial, Love? Is it not conceivable that this Being
which breathes good thoughts into every human breast
should love those whom It inspires? And we—can we
love our country, and love Goodness, Purity, Honour,
Faith, Hope, and yet must we find it impossible to love
this personified Love, this Holy Spirit? But if we love
the Spirit of God, and the Spirit loves us, then we can
understand how it may be called a Person.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I foresee the answer that might be given to these—I
will not call them reasonings, say meditations. “All
this is the mere play of fancy: you personify England,
Virtue, Goodness, Hope, Faith, and the like; and such
personifications are tolerable in poetry; but you do not
surely maintain that such personifications have any real
existence: in the same way, you may find a certain conception
of the Supreme Being useful for the encouragement
of devotion, but you have no right hence to infer
that this conception represents an objective reality, much
less God Himself.” My reply is that in the region of theological
contemplation where demonstration, and proof
of the ordinary kind, are both impossible, I conceive I
“have a right” to do this on the authority of Christ and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>St. Paul and the Fourth Gospel, and the general tradition
of the Church. I would sooner believe that myself and
my spirit have a dual personality; I would sooner
recognize the presence of the Angels of England and
France and the other great nations of the world about the
heavenly throne, like the Angels of the seven churches of
Asia or the Angel of the Chosen People; I would sooner
acknowledge the actual personality of Hope, Faith, and I
know not what other celestial ministers between God and
man; I would sooner, in a word, believe that personality
depends upon some subtle combination such as only
poets have dimly guessed at, than I would give up the
belief that there is beside the Eternal Father, and the
Eternal Son, an Eternal Spirit, to the description of whom
we can best approximate by calling Him personified
Love.</p>

<p class='c006'>Looking at the Spirit of God in this way I sometimes
seem to discern a closer connection than is generally
recognized between the Resurrection and the power of
loving. You will remember that St. Paul constantly
connects the Resurrection of Christ with the “Spirit;”
Christ was “raised from the dead <i>in</i>, or <i>by</i>, <i>the Spirit</i>;”
and St. Peter says that Christ was “put to death in the
flesh, but quickened <i>in the Spirit</i>.” Now this Spirit is
the Power of Love. Do we ask for an explanation of this
connection? It is surely obvious that the Resurrection of
Christ would not have directly availed men (so far as we
can see) unless it had been manifested to them. But
how was it manifested? We think it was by love: on
the one hand by the unsatisfied and longing love of the
sorrowing disciples, creating a blank in the heart which
could only be filled by the image of the risen Saviour; on
the other hand by the unsatisfied and longing love of the
Lord Jesus Christ, dying with a purpose as yet unfulfilled.
Thus—so far as concerns the influence of the Resurrection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>of Jesus upon humanity—it was the Spirit of Love that
raised Jesus from the abyss of inert oblivion and exalted
Him to the right hand of God in the souls of men.
I dare not say that, if Jesus had failed to root Himself in
the hearts of men He could never have been raised from
the dead; just as I dare not say that, if St. Peter had not
been inspired to say “Thou art the Christ,” the Church
could never have been founded on the rock of heaven-imparted
faith. Let us avoid this way of looking at
things, as being repulsive and preposterous, putting
things terrestrial before things celestial. Let us rather
say that, because the rock of faith was being set up by the
hand of God in heaven, therefore at that same instant the
Apostle received the strength to utter his confession of
faith; and because Christ’s Spirit had soared up after
death to the heaven of heavens and thence was bending
down lovingly to look upon His despairing followers,
therefore they received power to see Him again, living
for them on earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet as regards ordinary men, I cannot help occasionally
reviving that same preposterous method which I would
discard in the case of Christ. And starting from terrestrial
phenomena first, I sometimes ask myself, Is it possible
that the resurrection of each human soul may depend upon
the degree to which it has rooted itself in the affection of
others? The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the
condition of the dead may be affected by the prayers of
survivors; and many abuses have resulted from a perverted
and mechanical misinterpretation of that doctrine; but
how if the spirit of a dead man actually owes its spiritual
resurrection, not indeed to formally uttered petitions, but
to the silent prayers, the loving wishes, the irrepressible
desires of fellow-spirits on earth and in heaven? How if
a man lives in heaven and in the second life so far as his
spirit has imprinted itself on the loving memories of others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>above and below? “Has the dead man kindled in the
heart of one single human being a spark of genuine
unselfish affection? To that extent, then, he receives a
proportional germ of expansive and eternal life—might it
not be so? And if it were so, then we could better understand
how both the Lord Jesus Christ, and we mortal
men, die in the flesh but are raised to a life eternal after
death ‘in the Spirit’ and ‘by the Spirit’—that great
pervasive spiritual Power of Love which links all things
in heaven and earth together.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I trust I have theorized enough to please you. I have
done so because on the whole I think it best that you
should see all the weakness, as well as all the strength,
of my position—the credulous and fanciful side of it, as
well as its breadth, its naturalness, its reasonableness,
its spiritual comfort, its dependence on moral effort, its
recognition of Law, its consistency with facts, and its
absolute freedom from intellectual difficulties. Regarded
in the ordinary way, as being the revivification of the
material body, the Resurrection of Christ becomes an
isolated portent in history; regarded naturally, it becomes
the triumph of the Spirit over the fear of death, the
central event of our earthly history. Central I say, but
not isolated; because there are seen converging towards
it, as it were predictively, all the phenomena of the evolution
and training of the Imagination; all instances of true
poetic and prophetic vision; the stars of heaven and all
the creative provisions of night and darkness and sleep and
dreams, nay even death itself. And what higher tribute
(short of actual worship) can be paid to the personality of
Christ than to say that “the phenomena of His resurrection
are natural.” I think if I were depressed and shaken
in faith—as one is liable to be at times, not by intellectual
but by moral considerations, when one feels that evil is
stronger than it should be, both in oneself and outside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>oneself—it would be a great help to go and hear some
agnostic saying with vehement conviction, “The resurrection
of Christ was natural, purely natural.” I should
bid him say it again, and again; and I would go home
and say it over and over again to myself by way of
comfort, to strengthen my faith: “The manifestations
of the Resurrection of Christ were purely natural. So they
were. Things could not be otherwise. Being what He
was, Christ could not but thus be manifested to His followers
after death. It was the natural effect of Christ’s
personality upon the disciples; and through the disciples
upon St. Paul. Then what a Person have we here! A
Person consciously superior to death, and, after His
death, fulfilling a promise which He made to His disciples
that He would still be present with them! What wonder
if He is even now present with us, influencing us with
something of the power with which He moved the last of
the Apostles! What wonder if He is destined yet for
future ages to be a present Power among men until the
establishment of that Kingdom which He proclaimed
upon earth, the Fatherhood of God and brotherhood
of man!”</p>

  <h2 id='let25' class='c004'>XXV <br /> THE INCARNATION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>I had not forgotten that, in order to complete the
brief discussion of the miraculous element in the New
Testament, it is necessary to give some explanation of the
origin of the accounts of the birth of Christ. Your last
letter reminds me of this necessity, and you put before me
two alternatives. “If,” you say, “Christ was born of a
Virgin, then a miracle is conceded so stupendous that it
is absurd to object to the other miracles: but if Christ
was not born of a Virgin, then, unless the honesty of the
Gospel narratives is to be impeached, some account is
needed of the way in which the miraculous legend found
its way into the Gospels;” and you add that you would
like to know what meaning, if any, I attach to the statement
in the Creed, that Jesus was “born of a Virgin.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As you probably anticipate, I accept the latter of your
alternatives, and I will therefore endeavour briefly to shew
how the story of the Miraculous Conception “found its
way into the Gospels.” But first I must protest against
your expression as inexact. The story of the Miraculous
Conception, so far from having “found its way into <i>the
Gospels</i>,” found its way into only two out of the four,
namely, St. Matthew’s and St. Luke’s. And this fact,
strong as it is, does not represent the strength of the
negative argument from omission. Of the <i>nine</i> authors,
or thereabouts, of the different books in the New Testament,
only two contain any account, reference, or allusion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>to the Miraculous Conception. No mention is made of it
in any of the numerous Epistles of St. Paul; nor in any of
his speeches, nor in those of St. Peter, recorded in the Acts
of the Apostles, nor in any part of that book; nor in the
Epistles of St. John, St. James, St. Peter, St. Jude; nor in
the Apocalypse; nor in the Gospels of St. Mark and St.
John! Even the two Gospels that mention it contain no
evidence that it was known to any of the disciples during
the life-time of Jesus, and one of these (Luke iii. 23) traces
the genealogy of Jesus from Joseph and expressly declares
that He “was supposed” to be “the Son of Joseph.”<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
This negative evidence becomes all the more weighty if
you consider how very natural it was, and I may almost
say inevitable, that the story of a Miraculous Conception
should speedily find its way into the traditions of the early
Church. The causes that worked toward this result
were, first, Old Testament prophecy; secondly, traditions
and expressions current among a certain section of the
Jews; thirdly, the preconceptions of pagan converts.</p>

<p class='c006'>Recall to mind what was said in a previous letter concerning
the importance attached by the earliest Christians
to the argument from prophecy. Now there is a
prophecy in Isaiah which, <i>if separated from its context</i>,
might seem to point to nothing but the Miraculous
Conception of the Messiah: “The Lord himself shall
give you a sign: behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
a son and shall call his name Immanuel.” But a careful
study of the context puts the matter in a quite different
light. Isaiah (vii. 10-viii. 4) is promising to King Ahaz
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>deliverance from the kings of Syria and Samaria. As the
king will not ask for a sign, the prophet promises that the
Lord will give him one; a virgin shall conceive and bring
forth a child and shall call his name Immanuel (“God with
us”): he shall “eat butter and honey” when he arrives at
the age of distinction between good and evil; for before
he arrives at that age, the land abhorred by Ahaz shall be
“forsaken by both her kings.” The meaning appears to
be that, within the time necessary for the conception and
birth of a child, that is to say, in less than a year, the
prospects of deliverance for Judah from her present
enemies (Syria and Samaria) shall so brighten that a child
shall be born and called by a name implying the favour of
God; afterwards, before that child shall grow up to childhood,
the two aggressive countries of Syria and Samaria
shall be themselves desolated, as well as Judah, by the
“razor” of Assyria which shall shave the country clean
from all cultivated crops. Amid the general desolation,
the fruit trees will be cut down, the corn will not be sown;
bread there will be none; there will be nothing to eat but
“butter and honey;” it is not the new-born child alone
who shall eat “butter and honey;” “butter and honey
shall <i>every one eat that is left in the land</i>” (vii. 22).</p>

<p class='c006'>In all this, even though we may suppose that there may
have been some Messianic reference, there is no prediction
at all of a conception from a virgin or of a miracle of any
kind. Indeed, the prophecy appears to find some sort of
fulfilment in what happens immediately afterwards (Isaiah
viii. 1-4), when the prophet contracts a marriage, and calls
the son who springs from it by a name implying the
vengeance imminent on Samaria and Assyria: “Call
his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz (<i>i.e.</i> booty, quick, spoil,
speedy): for before the boy shall have knowledge to cry
my father! my mother! the riches of Damascus and the
spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>Assyria.” No doubt it may be said that this son was not
called “Immanuel,” so that the prophecy was not fulfilled
in him. But the same argument might be urged against
the application to our Lord; for He also was not called
“Immanuel,” but received the old national name of
“Joshua,” “Jeshua,” or “Jesus.” Reviewing all the
circumstances of the prophecy, I think we may say,
without exaggeration, first, that there are no grounds for
seeing in it any reference to a Miraculous Conception;
secondly, that, when isolated, it might easily be misinterpreted
so as to convey such a reference.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Even if no such prophecy had existed, the language and
preconceptions of the earliest Christians and their converts
would almost necessarily have introduced a belief in the
Miraculous Conception. The language of Philo—who
represents not a mere individual eccentricity but the
current phraseology of the Alexandrine school of thought,
and whose influence may be traced in almost every page
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>of the Fourth Gospel—consistently affirms that, whenever
a child is mentioned in the Old Testament as having been
born to be a deliverer in fulfilment of a divine promise, that
child is “begotten of God.” The words of Sarah, he says,
indicate that, in reality, “The <i>Lord begot</i> Isaac.” God
is also spoken of as “the <i>husband of Leah</i>.” Zipporah
is described as being “pregnant by <i>no mortal</i>.” Samuel,
in words that contain an implied belief that only his
maternal parentage was mortal, is declared to be “perhaps
a man,” and “born of a human mother.” I have already
quoted one passage about Isaac but another asserts that
he is to be considered “<i>not the result of generation</i> but
the work of <i>the unbegotten</i>.” Sometimes the language
of Philo is so worded as to convey even to a careful
reader the impression that he believed in a literally
Miraculous Conception, as for example when he says that
“Moses introduces Sarah as being <i>pregnant when alone</i>,
and as being <i>visited by God</i>.” Elsewhere, he removes
the possibility of misunderstanding by saying that “the
Scripture is cautious, and describes God as the husband,
not of a virgin, but of virginity.” None the less, you can
easily see how expressions of this kind, current among
Jewish philosophers a generation before the time of St.
Paul, might be very easily interpreted literally by ordinary
people unskilled in these metaphorical subtleties, and
especially by Gentile converts asking for a plain answer
to a plain question, “What was the parentage of this
man whom you call the Son of God?”</p>

<p class='c006'>In truth the preconceptions of the Gentile converts
must have played no small part in preparing the way for
the doctrine of the literal Miraculous Conception. The
Greeks and Romans who worshipped or honoured
Æsculapius son of Apollo, Romulus son of Mars,
Hercules son of Jupiter, and a score of other demi-gods,
would be quite familiar with the notion of a god or hero
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>born of a human mother and of a divine father; they
would not only be prepared for it in the case of Jesus,
whom they were called on to adore as the Son of God,
they would even demand and assume it. They would
argue much as Tertullian argued: “If he was the son
of a man, he was not the son of God; and if he
was the son of God, he was not the son of a man.”
This argument ought to have been met by a flat
denial, thus: “The mere physical and carnal union by
which, according to your legends, the gods, assuming the
forms of men, generated Æsculapius, Romulus, and
Hercules, is not to be thought of here. When we speak
of Jesus being the Son of God, we do not mean that His
body was formed by God descending from heaven and
assuming human shape or functions, but that His Spirit
was spiritually begotten of God. It is therefore quite
possible that Jesus may have been the Son of God
according to the Spirit and yet the son of man according
to the flesh.” But instead of that, the whole truth, there
came back this half-true answer. “The parentage was
divine, but not of the materialistic nature you suppose:
God did not assume human shape: the generation was
spiritual.” By these words there may have been meant
at first, simply what Philo meant, that while the spiritual
parentage was divine, the material parentage was human:
but such an answer would leave many under the impression
that the body as well as the spirit of Jesus resulted
from a spiritual generation in which no human father
participated. The Gentiles would naturally interpret the
Philonian doctrine literally and say of Mary, as Philo
had said of Sarah, that she was “pregnant when alone,
and visited by God.”</p>

<p class='c006'>From a very different point of view, the ritual and
hymnals of some of the Jews might facilitate the growth
of the belief that Jesus was born of a virgin. For they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>might naturally speak of their Messiah as being a child
of the virgin daughter of Sion, whose only husband was
Jehovah. And hence in the Apocalypse, a book imbued
with Jewish feeling, we find Jesus described (xii. 1-6) as
the child of a woman who evidently represents Israel:
“A woman arrayed with the sun, and the moon under
her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars; and
she was <i>with child</i>.... And she was delivered of a <i>son</i>,
<i>a man child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of
iron</i>.” This personification of the daughter of Israel or
of Jerusalem as representing the nation, the bride of
Jehovah, is very common in the prophets. You may find
similar personifications in the New Testament. The
Apocalypse describes the Church as the Holy City, the
New Jerusalem, descending from Heaven “<i>as a bride</i>
adorned for her husband.” St. Paul speaks of the New
Jerusalem, which is above (<i>i.e.</i> the spiritual Jerusalem,
free from the law), as being “the <i>mother</i> of us all.” Sometimes
the personification of the Church is liable to be
misinterpreted literally, as in St. Peter’s and St. John’s
Epistles, where “the elect lady” “thine elect sister” and
“the (lady) in Babylon” have been supposed by some
to refer to individuals, but are believed by Bishop
Lightfoot to represent the Churches of the places from
which, and to which, the epistles were written. The
whole of St. Paul’s Epistles presuppose the metaphor
of a Virgin Church, and toward the end of the second
century (177 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) we find a very curious passage (in
an epistle from the Church of Lyons) in which the
repentance and martyrdom of some previous apostates
are described as a restoration to “the Virgin Mother” of
her children, “raised from the dead.” You see then
how this personification runs through all Jewish and all
early Christian literature, so that the Church, old or new,
might be described as a woman; and I ought perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>not to have omitted the strange dream in the second
book of Esdras (x. 44-46) where Israel is a woman and
the Temple is the son: “This woman whom thou sawest
is Sion ... she hath been thirty years barren, but
after thirty years Solomon builded the city and offered
offerings, and then bare the barren a son.” Does not
this continuous stream of thought shew how natural it
would be for the earliest Jewish Christians to adore
Christ in their hymns as the son of the daughter of Zion,
the son of the Virgin Mother? Add to this the prejudice
among the Gentile converts against a human paternity for
the Son of God, the influence of the Alexandrine Jewish
philosophy and the still more powerful influence of Isaiah’s
prophecy about “the virgin,” and I think you will see that
the causes at work to produce the belief in the Miraculous
Conception were so strong that I may almost say a
miracle would have been needed to prevent it.</p>

<p class='c006'>But it has been urged that St. Luke was a historian and
a physician; that he had great power of careful description—as
may be seen from his exact account of St. Paul’s
shipwreck;—that he describes the circumstances of the
miraculous birth in a plain and simple manner: and that
he assures us that he had taken every pains to make himself
acquainted with the truth of the things which he
records.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c010'><sup>[34]</sup></a> All this may be: but because a man can describe
exactly a comparatively recent shipwreck, which he may
have himself witnessed, or which at all events may have
been witnessed by some who told him the story, it does
not follow that he has exact information about a miraculous
birth which occurred (if at all) upwards of sixty
years—more probably upwards of seventy—before he
wrote. The mother of Jesus had, in all probability, passed
away when St. Luke was writing. Such obscurities and
variations by this time attended the stories concerning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>the infancy of Jesus, that we find even the compiler of
St. Matthew’s Gospel apparently ignorant that the home
of the parents of Jesus was (if St. Luke is correct on this
point) not Bethlehem, but Nazareth. It is hardly possible
to deny his ignorance when we find in the First Gospel
these words: “Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem
of Judæa ... And he arose and took the young child
and his mother and came into the land of Israel. <i>But</i>
when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over <i>Judæa,
he was afraid to go thither; and being warned [of God]
in a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee and
came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth</i>.” Obviously
the writer is ignorant that “a city called Nazareth” was
the original home of the parents of Jesus, and that they
had no reason for returning to “Judæa;” his whole
narrative assumes that Bethlehem in Judæa was the home,
and that the parents of Jesus were only prevented from
returning thither by the fear of Archelaus, which forced
them to leave their native city and to take up their abode
in “<i>a city</i> called Nazareth.” Now it is probable that St.
Luke’s account is here the correct one, and that the
erroneous tradition found in the First Gospel was a mere
inference from the prophecy that “from Bethlehem” there
should “come forth a governor.” But what a light does
this discrepancy throw upon the uncertainty of the very earliest
traditions about the infancy of Jesus when we find <i>the
only two Evangelists who say anything about it, differing
as to the place where the parents of Jesus lived at the time
when they were married</i>! I have no doubt that St. Luke
did his best, in the paucity, or more probably in the variety,
of conflicting traditions, to select those which seemed to
him most authoritative and most spiritual. Even the most
careless reader of the English text must feel, without knowing
a word of Greek, that St. Luke’s first two chapters—which
contain the stories of the infancy—are entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>different from the style of the preface (i. 1-4), and from that
of the rest of the Gospel. The two chapters sound, even
in English, like a bit out of the Old Testament; and any
Greek scholar, accustomed to the LXX, would recognize
that they were either a close translation from the Aramaic,
or written by some one who wrote in Greek, modelling
his style on the LXX. It is probable that they represent
some traditions of Aramaic origin, the best that St. Luke
could find when he began to write of the wonders that had
happened more than sixty or seventy years ago. To those
who can form the least conception of the extent to which
Oriental tradition in the villages of Galilee might be
transmuted after an interval of sixty or seventy years, it
must seem quite beside the mark to assert the historical
accuracy of the tradition concerning the Miraculous Conception
which St. Luke has incorporated in his Gospel,
on the ground that he was a physician; that he took
pains to get at the truth; and that he has written a
masterly and exact account of a shipwreck which he, or
some friends of his, may have witnessed in person.</p>

<p class='c006'>The very sobriety of his own preface ought to put us
on our guard against attaching to St. Luke’s history such
weight, for example, as we attach to the history of Thucydides.
He says, it is true, that he had “traced the course
of all things accurately from the first, <i>i.e.</i> from the commencement
of Christ’s life:” but this amounts to much
less than the statement of Thucydides, who tells us that
he had personally inquired from those who knew the facts,
besides having seen some of the facts himself (Thuc. i. 22).
He does not say that “the eye-witnesses and ministers of
the word” had given <i>him</i> any special information: on the
contrary he mentions himself only as one of many who had
received “traditions” from eye-witnesses, and he implies
that a good many of the existing narratives, <i>based upon
these very traditions</i>, were at least so far unsatisfactory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>that they did not dispense with an additional narrative
from him. The emphasis which St. Luke lays on the fact
that he has traced things “from the first,” and that he
writes “in order,”—combined with the mention of
“many” predecessors who have “taken in hand” the
work which he intends to do over again—makes it almost
certain that some of these Evangelists had omitted all
account of our Lord’s birth; others had not regarded
chronological order; others had not written “accurately.”
All these deficiencies indicate a great and general difficulty
in obtaining exact information; and the mere
honesty of a new attempt, under circumstance so disadvantageous,
cannot justify us in attaching a very high
authority to a tradition in this new Gospel, of a miraculous
character, and in a style that appears to be not St. Luke’s
own, referring to an incident supposed to have occurred
upwards of sixty years before. This digression about
St. Luke’s Gospel will not be without its use if it leads
you to perceive that history, and experience, and criticism,
while they tend to make us believe more, tend also to
make us know less, about Christ’s life and doctrine;
I mean, that we find we know a little less about the
historical facts of Christ’s life than we supposed we
knew, while we are led to believe a great deal more in
the divine depth and wisdom of His ideas.</p>

<p class='c006'>I pass to the second question which you put to me,
“What sense, if any, do you yourself attach to the statement
in the Creed that Christ was born of a Virgin?”
Before I tell you what sense I attach to it, or rather
what sense seems to me the only one compatible with
the facts, I must honestly express my doubt whether any
sense that is compatible with the facts, is also compatible
with the words. To speak plainly, the statement
appears to be so obviously literal that I shrink from interpreting
it metaphorically; and yet, if taken literally, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>appears to me to be false. The word “Virgin” is perhaps
the only word in the service and ritual of the Church of
England (if the Athanasian Creed be left out of consideration,
owing to the non-natural and humane interpretations
of it which have been sanctioned by high authority) which
has made me doubt at times whether I ought to do official
work as a minister in that Church. As regards the “resurrection
of the body,” asserted in one of the Creeds,
I feel little or no difficulty: for St. Paul’s use of the term
“spiritual body” allows great latitude to those who would
give a spiritual interpretation to the phrase in the Creed;
and I trust that I have made it clear to you that I accept
Christ’s Resurrection as a reality, though a spiritual
reality.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c010'><sup>[35]</sup></a> But the words implying the birth from the
Virgin stand on a different footing. In the Resurrection
of Jesus I believe that there was a unique vision of the
buried Saviour, apparent to several disciples at a time;
but in the conception and birth of Jesus I have no reason
for thinking that there was anything unusual apparent to
the senses. What can I mean then by saying that Jesus
is “born of a Virgin”?</p>

<p class='c006'>All that I can mean is this. Human generation does
not by any means account for the birth of a new human
spirit. So far as we are righteous, we all owe our righteousness
to a spiritual seed within us; “we are not,” as
Philo would say, “the result of generation but the work
of the Unbegotten.” So far as we are righteous, we are
“born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the
will of man, but of God” (John i. 13). But of the Lord
Jesus Christ we are in the habit of saying and believing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>that He was uniquely and entirely righteous; and therefore
we say that He was uniquely and entirely born of
God. In all human generation there must be some congenital
divine act, if a righteous soul is to be produced;
and in the generation of Christ there was a unique congenital
act of the Holy Spirit. That Word of God which
in various degrees inspires every righteous human soul
(none can say how soon in its existence) did not inspire
Jesus, but was (to speak in metaphor) totally present in
Jesus from the first so as to exclude all imperfection of
humanity. Human unrighteousness—such as we are in the
habit of attributing to human generation—there was, in
this case, none. Therefore we say that the generation of
Jesus was not human but divine.</p>

<p class='c006'>So much I can honestly say because I heartily believe
it. How far one is justified in putting so strained an interpretation
on the words “born of the Virgin Mary”—even
in the Church of England, where simultaneous conservatism
and progress have been bought at the cost of
many strained interpretations—is a question on which I
may perhaps hereafter say a word or two, but not now.
Meantime let me merely add my conviction that there
may have been a time when this illusion of the Miraculous
Conception did more good than harm. In former days,
that spiritual truth which we can now disentangle from
the story of the Miraculous Conception may have been
conveyed by means of it to hearts which would have
otherwise never recognized that Jesus was the Son of God.
It was surely better then, and it is better now, that men
should believe the great truth that Jesus is the Son of God,
at the cost of believing (provided they can honestly
believe) the untruth that Jesus was not the son of
Joseph, than that they should altogether fail to recognize
His divine Sonship, because they were alive
to the fact that He was born of human parents in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>accordance with the laws of humanity. But in these days
the doctrine of the Miraculous Conception seems to me
fraught with evil; partly because the weakness of the
evidence makes the narrative a stumbling-block for many
who are taught to consider this doctrine essential and who
cannot bring themselves to believe it; partly because it
tends to sanction a false and monastic ideal of life; to
separate Jesus from common humanity and from human
love and sympathy; and to encourage false notions about
a material Resurrection of the body of Jesus, which
naturally result in a false, bewildering, and disorderly
expectation of a material Resurrection for ourselves.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>
  <h2 id='let26' class='c004'>XXVI <br /> PRAYER, HEAVEN, HELL</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'>You ask me whether one who has seceded from
miraculous to non-miraculous Christianity still finds himself
able to pray as before. But towards the end of your
letter you amend your question. You are “quite sure,”
you are pleased to say, from what you know of me, that I
shall “answer this question affirmatively, though in
defiance of all logic:” and therefore, anticipating my
answer, you state your objection to it beforehand, and ask
me how I can meet your objection, which is to this effect:
“If the laws of nature are never suspended, then it is
absurd, or perhaps impious, to pray for that which implies
their suspension. For example, a friend of mine may be
in a stage of disease so fatally advanced that, without a
suspension of the laws of nature, it is no more possible
that he should recover from the disease than that his body
should rise from the grave. According to the tenets of
your non-miraculous Christianity, must I not abstain from
praying that he may recover?”</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not see any great difficulty here. Change the
hypothesis for a moment. Suppose your friend to be no
longer living, but dead. Are you willing—would you be
willing, even were you the most orthodox believer in
miraculous Christianity—to pray that the body of your
dead friend might arise revivified from the grave a week
after he had been laid in it? You know you would not be
willing. Why not? You cannot say “Because it is impossible,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>for you would admit (on the supposition of your
being a believer in the miraculous) not only that it is
possible, but that it has actually been done in times past.
But you would feel, I am sure, that you dare not, and
ought not, to pray for this object, because such a prayer
would be a revolt against that established order of things
which you recognize to be a manifestation of God’s present
will. I say “God’s present will,” because you do not (if
you agree with me) regard death as being in accordance
with God’s future will: it is an evil, sprung, not from God,
but from evil, out of which God is working good. But
He bids us acquiesce in it during our present imperfect
state of existence; and hence, though you believe He
will ultimately destroy death, you do not feel justified in
praying that its present operation may be neutralized by
a suspension of the laws of nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now to return to your own supposition that your friend
is not dead, but merely in danger of death. Health and
life are dependent upon many complex causes, among
which (it will be admitted by all) are those mysterious
fluctuations of the thoughts and emotions, which I believe
in many cases to proceed—I speak in a metaphor—straight
from God Himself. To one who believes that
the spirits of men are in constant communion with the
all-sustaining Spirit of the Creator, the thoughts of men
may well seem to be as dependent upon their divine
Origin as the air in my little room is at this moment
dependent upon the changes of the circumambient
atmosphere. Of course, if you are a thorough-going,
scientific hope-nothing and trust-nothing, such a belief
as this appears to you an idle dream. From your
point of view, you are a machine; your friend is a
machine; all men are machines; the world is a machine;
the action and inter-action of all these animate and inanimate
machines is predetermined, even to the minutest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>movement of a limb, or most fleeting shade of thought, in
each one of the myriads of human mechanisms called
men.</p>

<p class='c006'>The thorough-going materialist, when he rebukes his
son and tells him that he “ought not to have” told a lie,
knows perfectly well that his son could not possibly help
telling that lie, and that he was bound by all the laws of
nature to tell it. The materialist father is, in fact, telling
a lie himself; only more deliberately than the little son.
He is using words which have no true meaning for him, as
a kind of oil to grease the wheels of the little machine
before him, having learned by accumulated experience
that this lying phrase, “You <i>ought</i> to have,” has for many
thousands of years proved a very effective kind of oil, and
that the true and scientific phrase, “It would have been
better if you could have, but you could not,” would be
wholly inefficacious. But since it is obvious that this view
of existence converts all moral language, and almost all
the higher relations of life, into one gigantic lie, I make
no apology at all for putting it by with contempt as being
beneath the consideration of a child of ten at which age,
as far as I remember I grappled with this question of
predestination, and settled it (so far as I was concerned,
for ever) by coming to the conclusion that “it does not
<i>work</i>.” Now when you have once given up, as unworkable,
the theory that all our thoughts and emotions spring
necessarily from antecedent material causes, you have
bidden good-bye to Knowledge, so far as concerns the
origin of human thought, and you are thrown back upon
Faith. I believe therefore, and I make no apology for
my belief, that the mysterious fluctuations of human
thought and will may sometimes proceed from God without
the intervention of material causes, perhaps in virtue
of the existence of some invisible law of union by which
the souls of men are united to God and to one another.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>This being my belief—which at all events does not contain
so many and such perpetually-recurring inconsistencies as
the belief of your thorough-going materialist—you will
understand, without much further explanation, when and
why I should pray even for those of whom the physician
is inclined to despair. Faith and hope, have, before now,
worked such wonders in healing, that “while there is life
there is hope” has passed into a proverb. I cannot be
sure that my prayers might not have some kind of direct
power—by a kind of brain-wave such as we have heard of
lately—in affecting the emotions and spirits of the sufferer.
It is seldom that even a physician can speak with certainty
about the immediate issue of a disease: and whatsoever
is uncertain is (if it be also right) a reasonable subject for
prayer. But if I were myself absolutely convinced that
there was no chance of my friend’s recovery without a
suspension of the laws of nature, I should feel that prayer
rightly and naturally gave way to resignation.</p>

<p class='c006'>No one however who is in the habit of praying will
think it necessary to spend much time or thought in
discriminating exactly between that which may be, and
that which cannot possibly be. He must know that, very
often, where his prayer trenches on the province of the
material, the line cannot be drawn except by an expert in
science, which he may not happen to be; and besides, in
the mood of prayer, he will feel that the scientific and
discriminating spirit is out of place. He is not thinking
of things scientifically, but spiritually, putting his wishes
before the Father in heaven, and content to couple each
wish with an “If it be possible.” Sometimes he learns,
after constant repetition, that the prayer is an unfit one,
and he discontinues it; in that case he has gained by his
prayer a closer insight into, and conformity with, the will
of God. In other cases he continues his prayer and
receives an answer to it—either the answer that he himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>desires, or some other perhaps, quite different from
that which he expected, but one which he ultimately recognizes
to be the best. But there will be cases where he
will continue his prayer, feeling it to be right and natural,
although he receives no answer to it at all, so far as he can
discern. For he will feel quite certain that no genuine
prayer is wasted. Our spirits, or our angels—to use the
language of metaphor—are not on earth: they sit together
in heaven, that is to say, in the heart of God; and whenever
one of us can conceive a genuinely unselfish and righteous
wish for a brother spirit and wing it with faith so that it
flies up to heaven—a flight by no means so easy or so
common as we suppose, and probably not often flown,
unless the arrow is feathered by deeds and pains as well
as words—then it not only brings back a blessing upon the
wisher but also thrills through the spiritual assembly above
and comes back as a special blessing to the person prayed
for. But need I add that this is not a process to be performed
mechanically? There is no recipe for effectual
prayer.</p>

<p class='c006'>But, to come down from metaphors, let me attempt to
answer your question, “What difference of attitude in
prayer will there be between the believer in natural, and
the believer in miraculous, Christianity?” As far as my
experience goes, there will be very little; except that the
former will be rather more disposed to ask, before uttering
a prayer, how far the granting of it might indirectly affect
others. Logically and theoretically there ought to be a
great deal of difference; for if the believer in the miraculous
were consistent, he might naturally pray that a miracle
might be performed for him, as it has been for others,
for a good purpose. As a matter of fact, the prayers
of children trained in orthodoxy are thus sometimes
consistent. I dare say one might find a child who has
prayed that the sun might stand still that he might have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>a longer holiday. And why not now from the child’s
point of view as well as formerly? But I suppose
few men in England, now, even of the strictly orthodox,
are in this puerile stage. Almost all full-grown English
Protestants recognize that, although miracles were freely
performed from the year 4004 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> to, say <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 61 or thereabouts—when
St. Paul shook off the serpent and took no
harm—yet “the age of miracles is now past.” Yet I have
heard of men of business who make a point of praying
earnestly on the subject of commercial speculations, the
rise and fall of consols, the price of sugar and the like.
Will any one maintain that people are not the worse for
such prayers as these, or that the believer in natural
Christianity is not a gainer by losing the desire and the
power to utter them? On the whole, I see but one
subject of prayer mentioned in our English Prayer-book,
as to which natural Christianity would probably dictate
silence: I mean the weather. It might be argued that,
“since the weather is affected by human action (by the
clearing of forests, draining of marshes, and so on), and
since prayers affect human action, therefore they <i>do</i> affect
the weather <i>indirectly</i>, and <i>may</i> affect it <i>directly</i>.” But
from “indirect” to “direct” is a great leap; and I am
moved toward resignation rather than prayer, by the
thought that, in revealing to us more and more of the
extent of the causes and effects of meteorological phenomena,
God seems to be shewing us that, in asking for
weather that suits ourselves, we may be asking for
weather that may not suit others. I should be sorry to
see harvest prayers excluded from our Church service;
but I think they should express our hope and trust in
God’s orderly government of the seasons, beseeching Him
to bestow on the husbandman patience and skill so as to
meet and improve adversity, and on the nation thrift and
frugality so as to avoid waste.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Since writing the last paragraph I was interrupted; and
now, returning to my letter, I feel strongly inclined to
cancel the last two or three pages of apologetic argumentation;
arguing about prayer seems so absurdly useless.
Yet perhaps my remarks may weigh for something with
you in your present oscillation. They may possibly
prevent you from giving up, in a moment of virtuous
logic, a habit which, once discontinued, is not easily
resumed. Let them pass then; but let them not pass
without a protest that they by no means express my sense
of the vital necessity of prayer for a Christian. To me
it seems the very breath of our spiritual life, as needful
for peace and union with God as communion between
children and parents is needful for domestic concord.
Without it, faith must speedily vanish. Even a comparatively
dull and lifeless petition at stated intervals has
some value as a sign-post, indicating the road on which
we ought to be travelling though our feet may be straying
elsewhere. But in truth real Christian prayer (mostly
silent) should be, as St. Paul says “without ceasing;”
for prayer is but aspiration and desire, emerging into
shape. When a man has reached such a height that he
has ceased to wish to be something better than he is,
then and then only may he cease to pray.</p>

<p class='c006'>One kind of prayer at all events I have felt able to
retain which seems to me of far more value than the
prayer for fair weather—I mean prayer for the dead. I
do not deny that, when coupled with superstitious views
about heaven and hell, the custom of praying for the dead
may result in superstition, and even in the encouragement
of immorality; and the hired and conventional prayers
for the dead prevalent in the sixteenth century appear to
me to have constituted an abuse against which our English
Reformers did well to protest. But these abuses and
corruptions seem to me accidental, and quite insufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>to deter us from use of the most helpful of spiritual
habits. I do not propose to argue about it, but you may
like to know the sort of accident by which I was led to
form this habit, and the practical reasons for which I
clung to it, and still cling to it, with the deepest conviction
that it is not only spiritually useful, but also based on
spiritual truth.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many years ago a brother of mine was drowned at sea
through the sudden capsizing of a vessel by night. When
the news came, I was at first distracted between an intense
desire to pray as before, and a kind of instinctive
and general repugnance to all prayers for the dead as
being “a Romanist practice.” All the books I had read,
and all the notions I had formed, about the fixed future of
the dead, suggested that such prayers were useless, if not
blasphemous. On the other side there was no argument
at all, nothing but a vague strong desire to pray. The
painful conflict of that night—a conflict, as it seems to me
now, between true natural religion and the false appearance
of revealed religion—is still present to my recollection.
At last it occurred to me that more than a month
had elapsed between the death and our knowledge of the
death, and throughout all those thirty days my prayers
had gone up to God for one whose soul was no longer
upon earth. Were those prayers wasted? I could not
believe it. Besides, we had not yet received full details of
the loss of the vessel. It was just possible that my brother
might have been saved in one of the ship’s boats: he might
be still living, and in sore need of help: how monstrous,
if it were so, that I should in such a crisis cease to pray
for him! So with doubt and trembling I still continued
my custom, fashioning some kind of prayer to suit the
emergency. While I was in this oscillating state of mind,
news came that a second boatful, and almost immediately
afterwards that a third, had been picked up at sea. My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>brother was not in either: but why might there not be a
fourth? For some time, with less doubt than before, I continued
to pray. Days, weeks, months rolled on, and now
all hope had slipped away; but the habit was now fixed.
I could not, or would not, break it. Praying day and
night for one who was possibly living; just possibly living;
probably not living; certainly dead—I had learned to
realize the presence of my brother’s spirit, as very near
and close to me, as one with whom I was still in some
kind of communion; and now to drop his name out of
my prayers, simply because I should never touch his
hand again in this world, seemed a faithless, a wicked, a
cruel act. The prayer could not indeed remain the same
in circumstances so completely changed; I could of
course no longer pray that the dead might be restored to
me on earth; but it was still open to me to make mention
of his name, and to beseech God that he and I might
meet again in heaven: and thus, with a curious kind of
compromise, worthy of a less youthful theologian, I circumvented
my own orthodoxy by still praying in reality
for my brother while I appeared to be praying for myself.
More than seven-and-twenty years have now passed away,
but not a night or morning has passed without the mention
of that familiar name; and I entreat you to believe
me that, next to the power of Christ Himself upon the
soul, I have not found, nor can I imagine, any influence
so potent as this habit of praying for the dead, to detach
the mind from petty and visible things, to unlock the
spiritual world, to carry the soul up to the very source
and centre of spiritual life, and to bring us into faithful
communion with the Father of the spirits of all flesh.</p>

<p class='c006'>You see I have kept my promise of not arguing on
this matter. I have simply told you how I have longed
and doubted; how my doubts were dissipated by practice;
and what strength I have personally derived from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>the practice. Probably this will seem to you, if interesting,
at all events inadequate. “Logically,” you will
perhaps say to yourself, “he ought to have attempted
first to convince me that the eternal state of the dead is
not finally determined at the moment of death; so that
prayer may reasonably be expected to have some power
to change their condition. He ought to have told me
whether he believes in a Purgatory, or in a limited Hell;
whether he is a Universalist; or whether he believes in
the annihilation of all who are not to be saved. In a
word, he ought to have given me a full account of his
theory about the condition of the dead, before he commends
to me the habit of praying for them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here I fear I shall terribly disappoint you; but, at the
risk of whatever disappointment, I will confess to you the
whole truth. This part of my Manual of Theology has
large print, large margin, and several blank pages. I
believe some things with such force and clearness that I
prefer to say I do not believe them. I <i>see</i> them: but
about many other things which most people believe, I
know little or nothing. Do I believe in a Hell? Yes, as
firmly as I believe in a Heaven; but not in your Hell
perhaps, and certainly not in the ordinary guide-books to
Hell and Heaven. Perhaps some would call my Hell
“merely retribution,” or “an illogical and ill-defined
Purgatory;” and from their point of view they could be
right in complaining of its indefiniteness; for they profess
to know all about it and to be able to define it. But from
my point of view I am equally right in speaking indefinitely;
for I profess to have only a glimpse of it. Of
the principles of Hell and Heaven I am certain, but of the
details I am entirely ignorant. I know nothing whatever,
and I know that no one else knows anything whatever,
about the state of the dead; except that they are just as
much in God’s hand when dead as when living, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>He will ultimately do the best thing for each; but what
that “best thing” may be I cannot tell in detail, although
I am very sure that it will be one thing for St. Francis
and quite another for Nero. For the rest, all the elaborate
structures and fancy-fabrics of Heaven and Hell, Purgatory,
Paradise, Limbo, and other regions, whether theologians
or poets be the architects, appear to me built
upon the flimsiest foundations, tags of texts, fragments of
words, quagmires of metaphor, quicksands of hyperbole.
No; such real knowledge—or shall we say such conviction?—as
we have about the eternal future of the dead, is
to be based, not upon argument or inference from minute
and disputable interpretations of small portions of Scripture,
but mainly upon our faith in the divine righteousness
and power. You will not, I hope, misunderstand my
words that “God will do the best thing for each,” or draw
from them the inference, “Then he is a Universalist after
all.” I took for granted—I hope I was not wrong—that
you would remember the definition of justice which you
have read in Plato. In fact therefore I merely expressed
in those words my conviction that God would be “just”
to us after death.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Might we not also define the highest
mercy, in the same terms in which we define the highest
justice, as being the feeling that prompts us to “do what is
best for each”? And, if so, does it not seem to follow that
in Hell God will not cease to be merciful, and in Heaven
God will not cease to be just? And hence are we not
brought close to the conclusion that Heaven and Hell are
not really places, but the diverse results of the operation
of the Eternal—the just Mercy, the merciful Justice—upon
the diverse dead? But here the question widens and
deepens into expanses and depths altogether too vast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>and profound for me, and I give up the problem. All that
I know is, that there will be hereafter a just retribution.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet if I am to tell you my own conjectural imaginations—for
who can help at times imagining what the infinite
unknown may be, however loth he may be to insist or
dogmatize about it, or even to bestow much attention on
it, when the urgent present presses its superior claims?—I
will say for myself that I cannot believe I shall
have served all my apprenticeship to righteousness in
my brief life upon this earth, or that I shall be fit
immediately after death, for that closest communion with
God which appears to me the Heaven of Heavens. Some
cleansing retribution, some further purification, seems to
me necessary and likely for myself—and, I must add, for
the greater number of those human beings with whom
I have had to do—before we attain to that blessed
consummation.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So you believe in a Purgatory then?” How do I
know? Say rather, I conjecture there may be many
heavens. In any case, I find it very easy to imagine a
retribution and a purification that shall be purely spiritual,
without having recourse to any material flames
or physical horrors. Some people find a difficulty in this
notion: they consider it, but deliberately put it aside; as
if mere remorse, sorrow, and self-condemnation, could
never be bitter enough to constitute a just Hell. I do not
think they have ever realized—perhaps they have never
tried to realize—the pain that may be felt by a spirit sitting
alone, away from this familiar world and every well-known
face, and quietly judging and condemning itself. A mere
accident, a ludicrous accident, once gave me a moment’s
experience of this feeling, and I have never been able to
forget it, never been able to put aside the conviction that
that feeling, intensified, might constitute Hell.</p>

<p class='c006'>It happened in this way. Some years ago, before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>nitrous oxide had come into very general use among
dentists, I went to have a tooth extracted, and determined
to try the gas. Perhaps I had some misgivings that it
was a little cowardly; perhaps I was a little nervous; in
any case I remember at the last moment thinking that I
should like to be conscious of the precise moment when
unconsciousness came; I remember struggling to retain
consciousness—even when a tell-tale throbbing in the
temples shewed that something new was going on—protesting
to myself that the gas had “no power,” “no power
at all yet,” “I don’t believe it’s going to have any power”—till
the portcullis came down. I suppose the consequence
was that I inhaled rather more than was usual;
and when I came to myself I heard the voices of the
dentist and the physician—a long way off, as it seemed to
me, but with perfect distinctness saying that “he was a
long time coming to” and they did not “quite like the
look of things,” and so on. Meantime I lay motionless
and without power either to move or speak, but perfectly
conscious. I took in the whole situation at once. I was
dead. I had passed into another state of existence. I
could think more clearly than before. I was a spirit.
And then the thought came pressing in upon me, as I
reviewed my whole life and the manner of my death,
that to avoid a little pain I had done a wrong thing and
had deserted those who needed me and would miss me.
No fear possessed me, not the slightest fear, of any external
punishment for the fault which I thought I had
committed: but in a detached solitude I seemed to be
quietly and coldly sitting in judgment upon myself, impartially
hearing what I had to say in self-defence, rejecting
it as inadequate, and passing against myself the verdict
of Guilty. Painful, increasingly painful, the burden of
this self-condemnation seemed to press and crush me down
more and more past power of bearing, so that at last,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>when in one moment I recovered both power of motion
and knowledge that I was alive again, I leapt up from the
dentist’s arm-chair, and, without taking the least notice of
the two operators, I gave vent to my feelings by shouting
aloud the well-known words from Clarence’s dream</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in16'>“—and for a space</div>
      <div class='line'>Could not believe but that I was in hell.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>I shall not easily forget the look of mingled humour
and horror with which the dentist replied, “Well, sir,
considering you are a clergyman, I should have hoped
it might have been the other place.” I tried to explain.
I assured him that it was a quotation from Shakespeare;
that I had not really believed that I was in the place
commonly called Hell; and so on. But I am quite sure
my explanations were utterly ineffectual; and to this day
I probably labour under the suspicion, in the minds of
at least two worthy persons, of having committed some
horrible crime by which my conscience is racked with
agony. In reality, however, it was a small offence, if any,
for which I suffered that bad quarter of a minute; and
I have often since thought that, if the mind is capable of
inflicting such pain upon itself for a venial error, those
pangs must be terrible indeed with which our sinful souls
may be forced to scourge themselves when we judicially
review the actions of a selfish life with a compulsory
knowledge of all the evil, direct and indirect, which we have
wrought, and when we realize at last—ah, how differently
from the dull, decorous, conventional contrition with which
we droned out the words on earth, kneeling on the hassocks
in the family pew—that “we have left undone those things
which we ought to have done, and done those things
which we ought not to have done.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But why do I thus discourse in detail upon a subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>about which I have admitted that I know no details? It
is in order to shew you that though I do not know much,
the little I do know greatly influences me. The thought
of a material Hell has probably contributed largely to
insanity, and has exercised a baneful influence upon many
women and children; but the majority of healthy men who
profess to believe in a pit of flame are little influenced by it.
It is so horrible, so unnatural, so unjust, that in their heart
of hearts they feel sure the good God cannot mean it; He
will let them off; or they will get off somehow—by absolution,
by forensic justification, by baptism, by uncovenanted
mercies, or what not. This is but natural. How can it
not be natural to believe that an unnatural and arbitrary
Hell may be dispensed with by an unnatural and arbitrary
indulgence? I have no such consolations. With me,
Hell is a different thing altogether: it is natural, it is
inevitable, it is just, it is merciful. Not a day passes but
I think of it and anticipate it in some sort for myself
and my friends. <i>Tout sepayera</i>: this act, I say, or this
neglect, was wrong, and must have been injurious: the
doers cannot escape from the consequences of it; I do
not wish to escape from the consequences of it. God will
work good out of evil; but He will be just, not indulgent.
I do not want Him to be indulgent. Thus Heaven and
Hell, impending over the routine of my every-day life,
become to me practical and potent realities; but they are
real to because the conceptions I have formed of them
are in accordance with the profound laws of spiritual
nature, and quite independent of the conflicting fancies of
theologians.</p>

<p class='c006'>Ask me what I trust to be in Heaven, and I can give you
no answer save that one which I have often given you
before—a being capable of loving and of serving God.
Ask me the nature of Hell and Heaven, and my only reply
is that they will be God’s retribution. Ask me whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>all will be hereafter “saved,” and I am silent, or merely
answer that God is good, and that I believe a time will
come when we, in Him, shall look back, and around, and
forward, and shall see that His work has been “very
good.” Enough for me to work and fight on the side of
God and against Evil, that His righteous Kingdom may
come and bring with it the time when His work will be
seen to have been “very good.” As for other details,
I know nothing and delight in knowing nothing. I do
not know whether I shall live again on earth or elsewhere;
whether I shall be a being of three dimensions, or four, or
of no dimensions at all; whether I shall be in space or out
of space. It is far better to give up speculations about
accidental trifles such as these: for accidents they are, as
compared with the essence of the second life, which consists
in Love. Do not give up the belief in that, at any
cost; least of all, at the cost of a little banter. “But
surely it is possible that our very highest and purest
conceptions of Heaven may fall short of the reality.”
Granted: but we must hold fast to the belief that there is
at all events a proportion between our best terrestrial
aspirations and their celestial equivalents. We must reject,
as from Satan, the suggestion (was it Spinoza’s?)
that there is no more likeness between God and our conception
of God than between the constellation Canis and
a dog. “God may not be Love:” I do not believe you:
but if He is not Love, He will be some celestial form of
Love, corresponding to our Love, only infinitely better.
“You will not retain your individuality:” possibly not,
but certainly we shall have something corresponding to
individuality, only better. And so of the rest. We shall
talk humbly, as beseems our microcosmic faculties; we
are but the transitory tenants of a little world, which is to
the Universe but as a dew-drop to the ocean: yet even a
dew-drop exhibits the same infrangible laws of light and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>the same divine glories that are manifested in the rainbow
and the sunset. So it is with a human soul: there
are laws in it of righteousness and justice and retribution—laws
which cannot be broken by the fictions and illusions
of theology, but must be manifested in all places and in all
time, now and for all eternity, on earth, in Heaven,
in Hell.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>I will begin this letter by quoting the end of your
last. For when you have thought over the matter I am
sure your mind will be so completely changed that unless
I send you an exact copy of your own words you will
hardly believe you could ever have written them. You
are speaking about the theology of St. Paul, and this is
what you say: “I presume that Natural Christianity,
however glad it may be to shelter itself under Pauline
authority in the low estimate it sets on miracles, will find
it difficult to digest or swallow Pauline theology. The abstruse
and artificial doctrines of the imputation of righteousness,
justification by faith, and the atonement, must
surely stand at the very antipodes of any religion, Christian,
or other, that can claim the name of <i>natural</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not believe you can ever have given five minutes
of attention to these subjects: or if you have, you must
have attended, not to St. Paul, but to some voluminous
commentator who has buried St. Paul’s text under his own
and other people’s annotations. Cast your commentaries
away. Read St. Paul for yourself in the light of his own
works and the Old Testament (especially the Septuagint
version), and I will guarantee that his general drift shall
come out clear and definite enough; and, what is more,
you shall acknowledge that his religion is perfectly
natural, so natural that you meet exemplifications of it
every day of your life, in every family, in your own home,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>in your own heart. It would be tedious if I were to give
you a scheme of Pauline theology and then shew you
the naturalness of each part of the scheme. For me it
would be long and wearisome; and you too would be inclined
to stop me at the end of every other sentence and
say “I know that St. Paul says this or that, but how is it
natural?” I will therefore begin at the other end, that is
to say, with Nature, and endeavour to shew you that the
natural history of a child, under favourable circumstances,
exhibits the general features of St. Paul’s theology, the
scheme of Redemption by which the Apostle believed
mankind to have been led to God.</p>

<p class='c006'>We begin then with a baby—a creature wholly selfish
(in no bad sense), say, “self-regarding.” He is of course
“in the flesh,” or “walks according to the flesh;” that is
to say, he obeys every impulse of the moment, and these
impulses are what we call animal impulses. He is conscious
of no Law, and therefore of no error: being “without
the Law” he “knows not sin.” As he grows up,
he finds himself making mistakes, trespassing against
Nature’s rules, playing with fire, for example: and Nature’s
punishment makes him conscious of mistake, and desirous
of avoiding mistake for fear of being punished;
that is to say, he learns to avoid playing with fire because
he has been burned for it. This is his first introduction
to “the Law;” and if he obeys Nature’s Law, through
fear of Nature’s punishment, or hope of Nature’s reward,
so much the better for him. Hitherto, however, there is
no question of sin, only of mistake. But now comes in
the parental Law, saying “Do this,” “Do not do that.”
Sometimes he obeys; sometimes, when “the flesh” is too
strong, he disobeys. In the latter case he is punished.
This new kind of Law is not a machine-like reward or
punishment like that of Nature: it is connected with a
Will, which is dimly felt by the child to be higher and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>better than his own, yet constantly opposed to his own.
Here then arises a conflict between his strong animal impulses,
<i>i.e.</i> “the flesh,” and a weak nascent impulse of conscience,
<i>i.e.</i> “the spirit;” the former bidding him disobey
the higher Will, the latter bidding him obey. Even when
he disobeys, the spirit has at least the power to make him
uneasy in his disobedience, and this uneasiness for the
first time reveals in him the nature of sin. Until the
Law of the higher Will was thus placed side by side with
his own will, and until the deflections of his own will from
the higher Will were thus made manifest and rebuked by
conscience, the child had no notion of sin. Now he
knows it: “by Law has come the knowledge of sin.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As long as he is thus “under the Law” he cannot
possibly be righteous; he can neither be “justified” nor
feel “justified.” When he is disobedient under the Law,
he is conscious of sin; but when he is obedient under the
Law, he is not conscious of peace or inward harmony: the
Law stands up, for ever antagonistic to his natural impulses,
and he cannot but dislike it, although he acknowledges
its claims upon him: consequently, even when he
obeys it, he obeys it with a sense of servitude, obeying in
the fear of punishment or in the hope of reward. Such
actions as are performed in this spirit have no spontaneousness
or grace; they are the tasks of a hireling, mere
piece-work—“works,” as St. Paul more shortly calls them.
or “the works of the Law;” and “by the works of the
Law shall no flesh be justified.” During this period he
finds no guidance from the spirit of loving obedience, but
has to trust in formularies and prescriptions, “do this,”
“avoid that;” he fears lest he may do too little, and
grudges lest he may do too much: he is in the condition,
not of a son, but of a servant working for wages. Just
as the Stoic said of the man who was not “wise,” that
whatever he did, even to the moving of his little finger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>was sure to be wrong, so St. Paul taught—and it is the
truth—that our every action, as long as we are “under the
Law,” is void of harmony, beauty, freedom, and spiritual
life: it is but obedience to a dead rule; such actions are
of the nature of sin and tend to spiritual destruction:
“the wages of sin are death.”</p>

<p class='c006'>During this state the raw, half-developed, ungraceful,
unharmonized, and ever-erring boy of fifteen appears to
have retrograded from the perfectly graceful and unconscious
selfishness of the innocent child of four. But it
is not so. The knowledge of sin is the stepping-stone to
a higher righteousness than could have been obtained by
perpetuating the innocence of childhood. Even during
the period of the “bondage to the Law” there were
occasional intervals of freedom, prophetic of a higher
state. Duty, sometimes, shining out before the child as
something purer and nobler than a mere inevitable debt,
appeared “sweet and honourable;”<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a> and wherever Duty
thus revealed herself, the child, in freely and ungrudgingly
obeying her, was obeying no unworthy emblem of the
Father in heaven; and by such obedience his character
was strengthened and matured. But now the time
has come for another step upwards. The boy disobeys
and is forgiven. At first, forgiveness makes no impression
on him. He does not understand it, does not
believe in it, because he does not quite believe in the
author of it; he regards his father as one too far above
him to be able to sympathize entirely with his boyish desires
and impatience of restraint, too much like a Law to
be capable of feeling real pain at his faults. As long as
he is in this condition, forgiveness comes to him as the
mere remission of penalty; he is glad to “get off,” but
his heart is not yet touched, and there is therefore no real
remission of sin, partly because he has no sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>sense of sin, partly because he has no faith in the
forgiver.</p>

<p class='c006'>But at last comes the revelation of the meaning of forgiveness.
Some outward sign, a mother’s tear, the mere
expression of the father’s face—it may be this, or it may
be something of much longer duration and far more complex—but
something at last brings home to him the fact
that his sin weighs like a crushing burden upon the heart
of some one else, who, in spite of his sin, still loves him
and still trusts in him. His parents, he finds—or it may
be some brother, sister, or friend—are bearing his sin and
carrying his iniquity as if it were their own: the shame
and the pain of it, which he feels as a mere unpleasant
uneasiness, are causing to others an acute sorrow of which
he had not dreamed before. Instead of being savagely
angry with him, furious at the mischief he has done,
and at the disgrace which he has brought upon them, instead
of visiting upon him all the consequences of his
fault, his parents are themselves suffering some part of it,
themselves crushed down by it: if they punish him, they
are not punishing him vindictively but for his good—it is
hard indeed to believe this, but he believes it at last—the
chastisement of his peace falls upon them as well as upon
him; their heart is broken and contrite for his sake; their
souls are a sacrifice for his; they feel his sin as if it were
their own; they have appropriated his sin; have been
identified with his sin; they are “made sin” for him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now if the youth has not in him the germ of faith or
trust whereby he can believe in the sincerity of these (to
him) mysterious and at first inexplicable feelings, why then
the parental forgiveness is worse than nothing to him.
If he resists its influence and calls it cant or humbug, it
hardens instead of softening the boy’s heart; and then
the little spiritual sensitiveness that he once had, dies
rapidly away. In this case “from him that hath not there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>hath been ta’en away even that which he seemed to
have,” and the good-tidings or Gospel of forgiveness has
proved, in this case, “a savour of death unto death.”
But if he has the germ of faith to begin with, then the
Gospel works its natural result: “to him that hath there
is added, and he hath more abundantly.” “Proceeding
from faith” the message of forgiveness tends “to the increase
of faith.”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Insensibly he finds himself raised
up from his former position to the level of those who
have forgiven him; he is identified with his forgivers in
spirit, so that he now sees things as they see them, and
for the first time discerns the hatefulness of sin, and
hates it as they hate it, and longs to shake it off as a
burden alien to his nature. At the same time, finding
himself trusted by those in whose truth as well as goodness
he himself places trust, he learns a new self-respect
even in the moment when he awakens to his past degradation;
he has (he feels it to be true) something within him
that may be trusted, some possibility of better things which
at once springs up into the reality of fulfilment under the
warm breath of affectionate and trustful forgiveness. In
other words, righteousness is “imputed to him,” and he
becomes righteous. The gulf between the parental will
and himself is now bridged over by a kind of atonement.
The relations which he imagined and created for himself
before between his parents and himself, were angry justice
on the one side, sullen obedience or open disobedience on
the other side: all this is now exchanged for an entirely
different relationship, love on both sides, kind control
from the one, willing, zealous obedience from the other,
resulting in perfect peace and in an atmosphere of mutual
goodwill, happiness, joy, favour. For this kind of “favour”
we have no exact word in English, but in the Greek Testament
it is called by a word which we must translate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>“grace:” the youth then is “no more under the law but
under grace.” No longer now is he a servant, performing
“works;” a community of feeling unites him with those
above him, whom he had once regarded as hostile and
despotic. No longer the slave of rules and orders, no
longer fearing punishment nor drudging for reward, he is
quickened by a spirit within him which guides him naturally
to do, and to anticipate, not only the bidding, but
even the unexpressed wishes, of that higher Will. His
whole life is now a service devoted to this new Master;
yet he is not a servant, but free, because he serves willingly
in a service which is the noblest freedom. The simplest
actions are performed in a fresh spirit; all things have become
new: the life of the flesh is ended, the life of the
spirit has begun. Looking back upon his former self he
finds that it is dead; he has died unto sin and risen from
the dead that he may live again to righteousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>Is it necessary for me to trace the parallelism between
these phenomena in the life of the individual and the
Pauline scheme of the redemption of man? You must
have recognized in each step of the development sketched
above some feature of the Pauline doctrine. My fear is,
not so much that you may fail to acknowledge this, as
that you may doubt whether the individual always passes
through these phases. But I am confident that it must be
so for all who are to be saved: there is no royal road of
privilege or miracle by which a man can pass from the innocent
selfishness of childhood to the practised righteousness
of manhood, without passing through the narrow defiles of
the flesh and fighting his battle with sin; nor do I believe
that any man, has ever been “saved,” that is to say, has
passed through that struggle so far safely as to attain
some thoughtfulness for others, some love of righteousness
for its own sake, unless he has received through the Word
of God some such revelation as I have described.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>The typical revelation of this kind, which sums up all
others, is the revelation made by the atonement of
Jesus Christ: but that revelation has been a silence for
the myriads who have died in ignorance of the very name
of Jesus: is there no other way then in which the Word
of God has taught them, redeemed them, forgiven them,
made atonement for them? Yes, assuredly the Word of
God has been mediating between God and men since men
first existed—long before the time when the children of
Israel “drank of that Rock which followed them, and that
Rock was Christ”—and the chief vehicle of His mediation
has been the influence of the righteous on the unrighteous,
especially of parents on children. In this influence, the
bright and central point has been the power which each
man has, in some poor degree, of forgiving, and making
atonement for, the sins of others—a power so weak and
small, compared with the same power in Christ, that it
may be easily ignored by superficial observers; and some
may think to do God honour by ignoring it. But in reality
whoso ignores it is ignoring the best gift of God to man.
This undeveloped power of forgiving has been that uneffaced
likeness of God in which He created us; and
every act of forgiveness, from Adam down to John the
Baptist, has been inspired by the Word of God to be a type
and prophecy of that great and unique act which sums
up and explains all forgiveness, the Atonement made by
the Word’s own sacrifice. I said above that the mother’s
tear might for the first time reveal to a child the meaning
and power of forgiveness. What the tear of a mother
may be to her child, that the Cross of Christ has been
to mankind; the expression as it were, of the Father’s
pitifulness for His sinful children, revealing to them the
meaning, and the pain, of forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c006'>St. Paul (you will find) in all his epistles recognizes the
analogy between the human race and the individual; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>all that he teaches about mankind corresponds to the development
I have tried to sketch above. You will be told
indeed that the attempt to trace such a parallelism as I
have traced above, is an attempt to “read modern thoughts
into an ancient author.” But do not be in haste to call St.
Paul an “ancient author,” not at least in any disparaging
sense, as if we had outgrown the antiquated limits of his
thoughts. Being a man of realities St. Paul dived deep
down below the surface of language, cant, and formularies;
he reached the very source and centre of the human
heart where righteousness is made. He realized the
making of righteousness as a visible process. Others,
who have not realized it, think his writings misguided,
antique, occasionally untrue. But do not you fail to distinguish
between St. Paul’s style and St. Paul’s thought.
He wrote in a hurry; he did not think in a hurry. The
general scheme of his theology needs no excuse, nor
allowance, nor patronage. His illustrations of it, arguments
in defence of it, even his expressions of it, are,
from our point of view, often inadequate; but his spiritual
truths are the deepest truths of human nature, as it may be
seen ascending through illusion and frailty to divine
knowledge and divine righteousness. St. Paul has been
wonderfully obscured by formularizing commentators.
The best commentary on him that I know is an ordinary
home; but for a young man, away from home, and in
danger of forgetting his childhood, the next best commentary
is Shakespeare, and the next to that is Wordsworth,
or, from a different point of view, the <i>In Memoriam</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>Tell me now; was I wrong in saying that the Pauline
scheme of salvation is eminently natural? I do not of
course mean materialistic, but natural in the sense of
orderly. Where, in the whole of this doctrine, is there any
necessity for believing that the Son of God—“born of a
woman” and manifested “in the flesh that he might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>destroy the works of the devil”—did or said anything
that involves a suspension of the laws of nature? I
have already shewn that the “miracles” wrought by St.
Paul himself were in all probability works of healing,
and natural; and the manifestations in which Christ
“appeared” to him and to the other disciples have been
shewn to be, in all probability, visions in accordance with
the laws of nature, though representing an objective
reality. There is no reference in St. Paul’s works to the
Miraculous Conception, nor to any of those miracles of
Jesus which, if historical, must be admitted to be real
miracles. On the other hand there runs through all his
epistles an acknowledgment of a continuous spiritual Law,
predetermined and inviolable. What else does St. Paul
mean by the continual assertion that the calling of the
Gentiles, and the “election” of all men, are “predestined?”
Perhaps you have never yet appreciated the circumstances
which led the Apostle to lay so much stress on the “predestination”
apparent in history. I do not think you can
ever understand St. Paul’s teaching on this subject, as
long as you fasten your attention on two or three isolated
texts which appear to set it forth. You must look at it as
a whole, and have regard to the motive of the author;
and then you will find that it is to be understood negatively
rather than positively. When St. Paul says “God predestined
this, or that,” he means, “God did not make a
mistake, or change his mind, about this or that: <i>the gifts
and calling of God are without repentance</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In setting forth Predestination, St. Paul is always
mentally protesting against two tendencies already perceptible
to him in the Church, the tendency of the
Jews to regard the admission of the Gentiles into the
Church as an after-thought, perhaps as a mistake;
and the tendency of the Gentiles to regard the Law of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>Moses as a complete and useless failure. It was one
of St. Paul’s main objects to shew that the history of
Israel and of the Gentile world revealed a thread of immutable
purpose of salvation running through the whole—a
purpose to subordinate evil to good, the flesh to the
spirit, the Law to the Gospel; so that there has been no
mistake, no dislocation of the divine scheme, nor change
of the divine will. Although the Apostle always refers
things to a Will and not a Law as their ultimate origin,
yet the whole tenour of his argument exhibits that Will as
being not liable to caprice or accidental shifting, but a
Will of predestination, a Law, so to speak, tinged with
emotion. No doubt St. Paul, sometimes, in the attempt to
shew the immutability of the divine purposes, puts forward
somewhat baldly and repellently the insoluble problem of
the origin of evil, as if God Himself predestined not only
rejection but also the sin that was the cause of rejection.
But it was not his intention to exhibit God as originating
evil; and the cause that leads him so to do, or so to
appear to do, is his intense desire to exhibit God’s
mysterious plan of not at once annihilating evil but of
utilizing it and subordinating it to good. The fore-ordained
purpose of God before the foundation of the
world is the redemption of mankind; and in order to help
men to attain to this height, the flesh, the law, death, yes,
even sin itself, are forced to serve as stepping-stones.
Hence even in rejection, as well as in election, the Apostle
cannot fail to discern the hand of God. There is a Law
in all God’s doing, and especially in His election. God
hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the
strong and the foolish things of this world to confound the
wise; the first-born is rejected, the younger son is chosen.
This is not accident; it is a type of the general law exemplified
in the vision of Elijah. Not by the whirlwind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>or the fire or the earthquake but by the quiet and neglected
processes of nature does God perform His mightiest works.
This deep truth pervades the doctrine of St. Paul. Pierce
through the antique and Oriental integument of his expression,
and you will find no other Christian writer who
so clearly brings out that the Christian religion is not
according to caprice but according to Law.</p>

  <h2 id='let28' class='c004'>XXVIII <br /> OBJECTIONS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>You tell me that you have been shewing my letters
to some of your young friends, and that they have expressed
various objections to non-miraculous Christianity. Some
say that I am an “optimist;” others that it is a compromise
between faith and reason, and that compromises
are always to be rejected; one says that I am for introducing
“a new religion;” others that a Gospel of
illusion must, by its own shewing, be itself illusive;
others, that “these new notions are so vague that they
can never be put into a definite shape, and they are
so mixed up with theories and fancies and suppositions
of error in every period of the Church, that they can
never commend themselves to the masses.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Do you know what “cant” means, and why it was so
called? “Cant” is the sort of language used (not always
deceitfully) when a man “chants,” or utters in a kind of
sing-song, words that he has not felt himself, or, if he has
ever felt, has ceased to feel, through the too frequent use
of them. Hence he cannot speak them, but “sing-songs”
them, “chants” or “cants” them. Now I take leave to
think that two or three of the objections above-mentioned
come under this head of “cant.” I mean that your young
objectors, not knowing exactly at the moment what to say
about opinions that are new and require some thought
to understand or criticise, and being desirous of saying
something at the moment, and something, if possible, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>shall be brief and smart, say what they have heard other
people say about other sets of opinions which have some
affinity of sound with mine. This is a very common habit
with inferior professional reviewers, who are bound to say
something readable and epigrammatic for limited remuneration
and consequently in limited time: but your friends
have not come to that yet, and are therefore not to be so
easily excused.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Optimist!” How can a man who believes in a real
Satan be an optimist? I thought an optimist was one who
believed the world to be the best of all possible worlds.
This I do not, and cannot, believe. I trust indeed that a
time may come when we may be optimists after a fashion;
when we shall look back, in God, upon the universal sum of
things and find that it has been the best possible under
the circumstances, and that evil has been marvellously
subordinated to good: but I never can believe that
a Universe in which God defeats Satan is better than a
Universe in which God reigns unresisted; and therefore,
as to this “best of all possible worlds,” I rest always
humbly silent. Some people may believe, if they can,
that evil is another form of good; that the world is like
one of those spectroscopes—I think they call them—where
several different pictures on a round card, each meaningless
by itself, are converted into one significant picture by
whirling the card round too quickly for the eye to follow.
In the same way they seem to suppose they can take little
pictures of oppression, adultery, murder, and the other
myriad shapes of sin, spin them round fast enough along
with other little pictures of temperance, purity, peace, and
all the virtues; and the whole becomes a panorama of
moral perfection! Argue thus who will; I cannot.</p>

<p class='c006'>If I am not an optimist in my view of this world, you
will surely not accuse me of optimism in my views of the
next. Do my notions of heaven and hell encourage any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>one to be selfish and luxurious or idle now, in the hope
that he will be let off easily hereafter? Have I not said
that there will be no “letting off”? That God will do
the best thing for Nero—is that do you think likely to
make Nero altogether an optimist in the life to come? I
think He will do the best thing for me; but I sometimes
shiver when I say it; awe possesses me, awe mingled
with trust, but certainly not without a touch of fear.
Assuredly the certainty of retribution in heaven makes
me no optimist for myself or others, as to the life
after death. In one sense only am I an optimist, that
I believe that the best will ultimately prevail, and that
faith, hope, and love, will prove the dominant powers in
the Universe. This I believe, and to this belief I cling
as a most precious hope, to be cherished by action as
well as by meditation; but this is not, I think, what is
ordinarily meant by optimism; and certainly it does not
encourage the spirit of <i>laissez faire</i> which optimism is
supposed to breed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next as to “compromise.” The ordinary cant about
“compromise” is sometimes the lazy expedient of those
who wish to avoid the trouble of coming to a decision, and
to shelter their indolence under a noble censoriousness.
What they mean by “compromise” is any theory that
attributes results to more than one cause. It is generally
very easy to elaborate some extreme theory which shall
explain almost everything by some single cause, by Faith,
for example, on the one side, or by Reason on the other;
and it is equally easy for the advocates on either side to
demolish the theory of their adversaries; but it is far
from easy afterwards to shew how, and to what extent,
<i>both</i> causes are accountable for the result which has been
fictitiously attributed to a single cause. Now the two
extreme parties, in their contests, afford us fine cut-and-thrust
exhibitions; the via media exhibits an organized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>campaign. The theatrical multitude, which does not care
in the least about truth, but delights in intellectual
slashers, soon finds it dull work, after clapping an exciting
<i>mêlée</i>, to have to sit still and listen to a dispassionate
and impartial discussion; so they cry “compromise” and
hiss. But the term is a misnomer. “Compromise,” or
“mutual promise,” cannot describe a legitimate conclusion
that hits the mark missed by two previously divergent
shots. It is as if A were to hit the top of the target, and
B the bottom, and then both A and B were to fall foul of
C, and accuse him of “compromising”, because he pierces
the bull’s eye half way between the two. “Compromise”
often implies a failure of exact justice; as when Smith
thinks Jones owes him 50<i>l.</i>, and Jones thinks he owes Smith
only 40<i>l.</i>; and they “split the difference” and make it
45<i>l.</i>; both of them thinking that the arrangement is
unjust, but both preferring the injustice to the expensive
formalities of legal justice. This is “compromise,” and
illogical; but there is none of this illogicality in a fair
impartial discussion avoiding previous bias.</p>

<p class='c006'>So in the present instance. Some have been biassed in
favour of Faith, others in favour of Reason; some have
accepted as historical all the miracles and mighty works
in the Old and New Testament indiscriminately, others
have rejected all indiscriminately; some have declared
that every word in the Old and New Testament (I don’t
quite know how they have got rid of the difficulty of
various readings) is exactly inspired and every detail
historically true; others, that there are so many errors
and illusions that the books may be put aside as no
better than myths: some have said that, since we cannot
worship an unknown Being, we must worship the human
race; others that, since we cannot worship our very
degraded selves, we must worship some being altogether
different from ourselves: some have said that Christ is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>God, and have ignored His humanity; others have said
that He was a “mere man,” and therefore not divine.
Now in all these cases the truth lies between the two
extremes. Man derives religious truth from Faith, but
Faith assisted by Reason; Christ did not perform
miracles, but He did perform mighty works; the Old and
New Testament, like all other vehicles of revelation,
contain illusion, but illusion preserving and protecting
truth; we must not worship ourselves, and yet we cannot
worship one who is altogether different from ourselves;
Christ is a man, and yet Christ is God. But to all these
conclusions we are not led by “mutual promise,” give
and take of any kind, but by full and unbiassed consideration
of all sides of the subject, knowing that (for the
present at all events) we shall displease all, both the
orthodox and heterodox alike.</p>

<p class='c006'>So far from suggesting any compromise between Faith
and Reason, I have merely pointed out that the provinces
of the two are, to a very large extent, distinct, so that
many of their operations can be performed altogether
independently. I have never said, “Do not follow out
the conclusions of your Reason in this or that instance
because you would be led to inconvenient results,” but,
“Follow out the conclusions of your Reason in every
instance and presently acknowledge that you are led, in
some cases, to results so absurd and unpractical that you
must infer Reason to be out of its province in these cases.
Reason your utmost for example about a First Cause and
Predestination and the Origin of Evil and the like; but
then, when you have come to the conclusion that, logically
speaking, it is equally absurd to suppose that the world
had no cause, and that the First Cause had no cause, give
the subject up as being beyond the syllogistic powers.”
Surely there is no unworthy compromise here, nothing
but common sense! Wherever historical facts are affirmed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>in religion, I have said that the accounts of those facts are
to be judged upon evidence and by Reason alone; here
Faith and Hope have no place; history in the New
Testament is to be judged like history in Thucydides.</p>

<p class='c006'>In reality it is not I with my via media that am guilty
of compromise; it is the Hyper-orthodox (if I may use a
term that is nominally meaningless but really quite intelligible)
and the Agnostic. For the Hyper-orthodox say
“Accept the Scriptures in a lump.” Why? “Because it
would be so very inconvenient not to have an infallible
guide.” Of course they do not say so in these precise
words: but this is what their replies ultimately amount
to. Again the Agnostics say, “Reject the Scriptures
<i>in toto</i>.” Why? “Because it would be so very inconvenient
to weigh evidence and discriminate the true from
the false.” It is these, not I, who are calling in emotion
to do the work of Reason, and who (partly, I think, to
avoid facing unpalatable facts) force Reason to make a
compromise with prejudice. “Convenience,” as I have
pointed out in a previous letter, may be a legitimate basis
for accepting as a Law of Nature the tried and tested
suggestions of the Imagination; but it is not a legitimate
basis on which to construct a belief in the genuineness of
the Book of Daniel or the Second Epistle of St. Peter.</p>

<p class='c006'>Let me mention one point where, in appearance, but
not in reality, my theory is liable to the charge of compromise:
I mean the discussion of the Miraculous Conception
and the Supernatural Incarnation. In discussing the
Miraculous Conception I have advised you to trust to your
Reason alone, because here you have to deal with a statement
of physical facts, true or untrue, and to be proved
or disproved by evidence; but as regards the Supernatural
Incarnation and the statement that the Word
of God became a human spirit, I have pointed out that
here we have a statement that cannot be proved or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>disproved by simple historical evidence, nor even by
miracle, because even if an archangel descended from
heaven to trumpet forth a “Yes” or “No” to the
world, the message might be from the Devil. If then
we are to believe in the Incarnation we must have a
twofold testimony. First must come the historical evidence
indicating the words, and deeds, and character,
and results, of the life of Christ, the truth of which
must be judged by the Reason; and then there must
come the witness of the conscience exclaiming “This
life is divine; this man is one with God.” Consequently
it is quite possible to accept the Supernatural
Incarnation while denying the Miraculous Conception;
and this I have felt obliged to do. But where is the
compromise or inconsistency? I am compelled by evidence
and Reason to deny the truth of the Miraculous
Conception, on account of the very small amount of
evidence for it and the very large amount of evidence
against it; I am equally compelled by evidence and
Faith to accept the Supernatural Incarnation, because
the evidence convinces me that a certain life has been
lived on earth, and my conscience convinces me that this
life could not have been lived by any being who was not
one with God.</p>

<p class='c006'>Are my accusers equally free from confusion? I think
not. Ask the Hyper-orthodox why they believe in the
Miraculous Conception in spite of the silence of all the
earliest documents; they will reply, (if you penetrate
below their first superficial answers, such as, “Because
it is in the Bible,” “Because I have believed it from
my youth upward,” and the like), “Jesus must have
been born miraculously, because He was the Son of God”—a
confusion of things historical and spiritual, and a
manifest expulsion of Reason from her rightful province.
Again, ask the Agnostic why he does not believe that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>Jesus was the Son of God; he will reply that he sees no
proof of the fact, nor even of the existence of a God;
and if you press him to define what he means by “proof”
of the existence of a God, you will find that he wholly
ignores the influence of Imagination as a means of arriving
at truth, and that he requires some kind of evidence
that shall entirely dispense with Faith. Thus the Hyper-orthodox
and the Agnostic are equally guilty, the one of
dispossessing Reason, the other of dispossessing Faith,
from their rightful provinces; and they accuse me of
“compromising,” not because I really compromise, but
because I pursue truth at the cost of some trouble, while
they—partly perhaps to avoid the pain of thinking, and
the prospect of colliding with hard unpleasing truths—pursue
severally that form of untruth to which they are
inclined by prejudice.</p>

<p class='c006'>And now for the next objection, that “this is a new
religion.” How can men give the name of a new religion
to that which proclaims as the one means of salvation the
Eternal Word of God believed in of old by Jews as well
as by Christians? Or is it a mark of novelty to accept
Jesus of Nazareth as that Word incarnate? The one
thing new about the opinions put forward in my letters is
this—that it is not a necessary condition for believing
in Christ, that men should accept a number of historical
statements which are, and have been, doubted by many
honest seekers after truth. I believe I might add, without
any exaggeration, that the statements which I impugn are
rejected by so large a number of those who are most competent
to judge, that, in spite of many inducements—some
richly substantial, some nobly spiritual—many of the ablest
and best educated young men of England cannot in these
days be persuaded to become ministers of the religion which
appears to insist on them. Beyond this protest, there is
nothing, or very little, that is new about the theory which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>I have endeavoured to set forth. I do not protest against
any moral abuse in the Church of England or the
orthodox churches—such abuses as made a great gulf in
the days of Luther between the Roman Catholic Church
and the Protestants, when indulgences for sins were sold
by the cart-load. Possibly indeed the protracted belief
in the miraculous, when it has long outlived the conditions
which made it natural or pardonable, may tend to produce
some moral evil; some over-estimation of ostentatious
and, so to speak, theatrical force; some depreciation of
the quiet processes by which God has mostly taught and
shaped mankind; some latent trust in a capricious God,
who will not “reward men according to their works” but
will exercise a dispensing power at the Day of Judgment.
I say this may possibly soon happen, if it has not already
begun to happen; but at all events it is at present latent,
and it is not on any ground of this kind that I am advocating
a new view of the Old and New Testament. My
object has been not to destroy the old belief, but to
remove certain obstacles which tend to prevent people
from embracing the essence of the old belief. The
existence of a God, the immortality of the soul, the
conflict between God and Satan, the redemption of mankind
through the sacrifice of the eternal Son of God
incarnate in Jesus of Nazareth, the Resurrection of the
Lord Jesus, the operation of the Holy Spirit, the certainty
of a heaven and hell, the efficacy of prayer, the ultimate
triumph of goodness and God— all these things I steadfastly
believe. But I see not the slightest reason why, in
order to hold fast these precious truths, I should be compelled
to believe that Joshua stopped the sun (or the
earth?) or that an ass talked with a human voice, or that
the incarnate Son of God drowned two thousand swine or
destroyed a fig-tree with a word.</p>

<p class='c006'>I am probably doing no more than give utterance to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>thoughts which have been already expressed by others, or
which, though unexpressed, are latent in thousands of
doubtful and expectant souls. But even were it otherwise,
even were it granted that the form of Christianity set
forth in my letters has some points of novelty, is mere
novelty to suffice for its condemnation?—and this in our
century, when God has been teaching and is teaching
His children so much that is new in every department of
knowledge! Is it absolutely incredible that the same
Supreme Teacher who allowed some nineteen centuries to
elapse between the Promise and the promised Seed, should
allow another nineteen centuries to elapse between the
Seed and the Harvest? Is it inconsistent that He who
has led men to the truths of science through mistakes and
illusions should lead men by the same paths to spiritual
truth? How often must the Law of Illusion be inculcated
before we take it to heart? Illusions have encompassed
spiritual truth for Israel, for the Jews, for the Twelve in
their Master’s lifetime, for the first generation of Christians,
and for every subsequent generation down to the time of
Luther. So much we Protestants are bound to admit.
Are we not then intolerably presumptuous in assuming
that illusions must have suddenly disappeared in the
fifteenth century and have left the theological atmosphere
for the first time since the creation of the world free from
all spiritual refraction? How much humbler and truer
to suppose that every century and every generation has
its special cloud of illusions through which in due course
we must all toil upward, penetrating layer after layer of
the illusive mist till we reach at last the summit of the hill
of Truth!</p>

<p class='c006'>I find I have left myself too little time to answer your
last two objections as to the “vagueness” of my views and
their inability to “commend themselves to the masses.”
I will try to answer them in my next letter.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>
  <h2 id='let29' class='c004'>XXIX <br /> THE RELIGION OF THE MASSES</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>I have been thinking over your objection that my
notions are “vague;” feeling that there is some truth in it,
but that your words do not quite express your probable
meaning. I think you mean, not that the “notions” are
vague, but that the proofs are vague. The “notions” are
in the Creeds, if you interpret the Creeds spiritually: and
I do not think that the Creeds are more “vague” when
interpreted spiritually than when interpreted literally.
The spiritual Resurrection of Christ, for example—is it
more vague than the material Resurrection? If you admit
that there is a spirit in man, and that this spirit is made
apparently powerless by death, is it “vague” to say that
the spirit of Jesus, after passing through this state of
death, manifested itself to the disciples in greater power
than ever? Even those who maintain the material
Resurrection admit that it would be a mere mockery without
the spiritual Resurrection, and that the latter is the
essence of the act: so that to declare the statement of the
spiritual Resurrection of Jesus to be “vague,” appears to
be equivalent to declaring that <i>any</i> statement of the <i>essential</i>
Resurrection of Jesus is “vague.” Again, redemption
from sin is a spiritual notion, redemption from the
flames of a material hell is a material notion; but is the
former more “vague” than the latter? If so, then we are
led to this conclusion, that all spiritual notions are more
vague than material notions; and the vagueness which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>you censure is a necessary characteristic of every religion
that approaches God as He ought to be approached, I
mean, as a Spirit and through the medium of spiritual
conceptions. But to my mind you are not justified in thus
using the word “vague,” which ought rather to be applied to
notions wanderingly and shiftingly defined; as for example,
if I defined the Resurrection of Jesus as being at one time
the rising of His body, at another the rising of His Spirit;
or if I spoke of redemption, now as deliverance from sin,
and now as deliverance from punishment. Convict me
of such inconsistencies, and I will submit to be called
“vague;” but at present I plead, “Not guilty.”</p>

<p class='c006'>However I think you meant that the proofs, and not the
notions were vague; and here, although you should not have
used the word “vague,” I will admit that you would have
been right if you had said that they were “complex” and
“more easy to feel than to define.” No doubt the proof of
Christ’s divinity from the material Resurrection is simple
and straightforward enough: “It is impossible that a man’s
body could have arisen from the grave, and that the man
could have afterwards lived with his friends on earth for
several days, and then have ascended into heaven, if he had
not been under the express protection of God; and such a
man we are prepared to believe, if he tells us that he is the
Son of God.” That certainly would seem to a large number
of minds a very plain and straightforward argument—as
plain as Paley’s <i>Evidences</i>. No trust, no faith, no
affection, is here requisite: nothing is needed except that
rough and ready assumption—in which we are all disposed
to acquiesce—that any altogether exceptional and startling
power must come from God. It must be admitted that this
sort of proof would be cogent as well as direct. Let a
man rise from the dead to-morrow, and transport his body
through closed doors, and say that he is Christ, and then
mount up to the clouds and disappear; and I doubt not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>many of those who saw him would cry “This must be the
Christ,” without so much as enquiring what manner of
man he was. But cogent and popular and delightfully
simple though it may be, this is not the kind of proof on
which Jesus appears to have relied, or by which Jesus has
produced a spiritual change in the hearts of mankind. The
very fact that no trust or faith or affection is needed in such
a demonstration, unfits it for spiritual purposes. In order to
believe in the Resurrection of Jesus, a man needs the testimony
of all his powers, emotional as well as intellectual, trust
and love as well as reason; and I have endeavoured to
shew above that the whole of the training of the human
Imagination, and all the mysterious natural provisions
which have stimulated the eye of the mind to see what the
eye of the body cannot see, have contributed to bring
about the faith in the risen Saviour. As we are to love
God with our strength and with our mind as well as with
our heart and our soul, so are we to believe in Christ with
the same collective energy. The proof therefore of
Christ’s Resurrection and of Christ’s divinity is intended
to be, in a certain sense, complex, because it is intended
to appeal to our every faculty and to be based upon our
every experience.</p>

<p class='c006'>But “this form of Christianity can never commend
itself to the masses.” Objection in the shape of prophecy
is always difficult to meet, and not often worth meeting.
However, this prophecy has so specious a sound that it
deserves some reply. But first let me ask, Does the
present form of Christianity commend itself to the masses?
Surely not to the very poor, that is to say, not to the class
to whom Christ appears to have specially addressed Himself.
And even among the classes which retain the tradition
of worshipping Christ, has Christianity been such as
would commend itself to Christ? Has not our religion
been too often divorced from morality? Has there been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>dominant among us that habit of mutual helpfulness—“comforting
one another,” as St. Paul calls it—which is
the criterion of a truly Christian nation? Have not the
laws in almost all cases, until the French Revolution, been
made in the interests of the rich, rather than in the interests
of the poor; and where the poor have been considered,
has not the consideration arisen largely from the fear of
violence and revolution? There has been a certain amount
of alms-giving, or legacy-leaving, on the part of the minority
who have laid themselves out to lead religious lives; and
there has always been a still more select minority who
have been imbued with a truly Christian enthusiasm for
their fellow-creatures, a passionate desire to do something
for Christ, and to leave the world a little better for their
having lived: but the great unheeding mass of men in
Christian countries has rolled on in its selfish path, less
selfish certainly, less brutishly intent on present pleasure
than the masses of heathendom, and indirectly humanized
and leavened by a thousand Christian influences, but
still not more than superficially Christian. The reason for
this comparative failure has been, in part, that Christ
has not been rightly presented to the hearts of the people.
Too often it has not been Christ at all—it has been
but a lifeless semblance of Christianity—to which they
have given their adhesion. The fear of hell, the hope
of heaven—these have been often the chief motives of
religion; and alms-giving, church-going, Bible-reading,
and the use of the sacraments, have been the means by
which men have thought they could escape the one and
secure the other. Asking still further the cause for this
perversion, by which Christ has been converted into a
second Law, we find that in some cases and more
especially in recent times, it appears to have arisen
in part from the miraculous element in our religion.
This has made Christ unreal to some of us by taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>Him out of the reach of our sympathies and affection;
this also has artificialized our religious conceptions and
divorced our religion from morality by making us think
that God will suspend the laws of spiritual nature for us,
as He has suspended the laws of material nature for
Christ and Christ’s Apostles. Hence has arisen too often
a pitiable and preposterous reversal of the Pauline theology.
We have “died” unto Christ, and “risen again” unto the
Law. “Grace” has fled away, and, with it, all natural and
harmonious morality; and the whole duty of a Christian
man has been degraded to a routine of “works.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is for this cause that the morality of Agnostics
frequently surpasses the morality of professing Christians.
The philanthropy of the former, so far as it goes, is at
all events perfectly natural. They do not love their
brother man in order to obey the Gospel or save their
own souls; they love because they must love. Christ’s
heaven is often in their hearts without any of the corruptions
of a conventional Christianity. They do not believe
in a capricious Heaven and Hell, but they are drawn
towards goodness, kindness, justice and mutual helpfulness,
whenever and wherever they see them; and such worship
as they have, they give to these qualities. Hence also in
foreign politics the working people and the Agnostics
often manifest a much purer and more Christian feeling
than church-goers. For the Hyper-orthodox, foreign
politics lie outside the Bible; and whatsoever lies outside
the Bible lies, for them, outside morality: but the
Agnostic makes no such distinction; he does not believe
that the laws of right and wrong can be miraculously
suspended in favour of his own country. The disbelief in
a future Heaven makes the poor indisposed to tolerate
present remediable miseries in the hope of coming compensation.
Hence they shew a much stronger determination
not to put up with a state of things in which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>happiness and prosperity of a whole nation are purchased
by the misery of one class. They are willing enough
individually to make sacrifices for one another, and, in
bad times the working people have sometimes collectively
borne considerable burdens with an admirable patience;
but that the unwilling wretchedness of some should form
the basis of the prosperity of the rest, and that the rest
should be content to have it so—this they cannot endure;
and sooner than this, they would prefer to see every class
in the nation pulled down two or three degrees in wealth
and refinement, if thereby the lowest class could be raised
a single degree.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rich church-goers are far more ready to acquiesce in
present inequalities, sometimes consoling themselves with
the thought that in heaven all these evils will be redressed,
sometimes fortifying their acquiescence in the
inevitable with a text of Scripture. But the poor declaim
passionately against the Bible, when thus quoted—as being
a mere instrument in the hands of the rich, and the priests
their accomplices, to keep the miserable in a state of
contentment with their misery. It is a pity that the poor
should be embittered by misrepresentations against that
which is pre-eminently the poor man’s Book; for no tribune
or democrat more persistently than the Bible takes the
side of the oppressed, or more emphatically declares that it
is part of God’s method to raise up the poor from the dung-hill
and to fill the hungry with good things, while He casts
down the princes and sends the rich empty away. But the
fact remains that, even when he raves against his own Book,
the poor man is raving in the spirit of the Book. It is not
in accordance with the Bible—and still less in accordance
with the spirit of the New Testament and of Christ—that
any nation should tolerate and perpetuate the misery of
a class in order that the whole nation may prosper.
Indeed in such a nation permanent prosperity—in any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>sense, and much more in the Christian sense—is quite
impossible. Even though they may suppress rebellion
and escape revolution for the time, the governing classes
cannot escape the spiritual evils that must ultimately
spring from that comfortable acquiescence in the
wretchedness of others to which they may give the
name of resignation but to which Christ would have
given the name of hypocrisy. Material misery <i>may</i> imply
the immorality of those who are forced to endure it; but
it <i>must</i> imply the immorality and spiritual degradation
of those who acquiesce in it because it does not come nigh
them, and because “the Bible says it must be so.” Let
but such Pharisaism continue for a generation, and it will
have gone far to extinguish the purest of religions and to
prepare the way for revolutionary strife.</p>

<p class='c006'>It appears then that what is called “socialism” is really
nothing but a narrow and unwise form of Christianity;
narrow because it excludes the rich from its sympathies,
and unwise because, instead of going to the root of evils,
it simply aims at the branches; capable also, of course,
(like every other theory) of being made to appear immoral,
when adopted for self-interested or vindictive purposes—yet
nevertheless containing much more of the
Spirit of Christ than that selfish form of Christianity
which has for its sole object the salvation of the individual.
Socialism owes all that is good in it to Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'>The gigantic evil of slavery (which is antagonistic to all
true socialism) after a contest of eighteen centuries, has
succumbed at last in Christian countries to Christ’s Spirit
and to no other champion. Do you suppose that it perished
owing to the “march of intellect,” or the discoveries
of science, or the general refinement and rise in the standard
of comfort and happiness among mankind? There
is no reason at all for thinking so. The Law of Moses,
as you know, recognized, though it controlled and mitigated,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>the institution of slavery. The race that gave
birth to Socrates, Aristotle, Sophocles, Phidias, Euclid,
Archimedes, and Ptolemy, was unable so much as to
conceive of a state of society where slavery should not
exist: civilization appeared to them to require the servitude
of the masses as its necessary foundation. It was
not cruelty or callousness that prompted Aristotle to
divide “tools” into two classes, “lifeless” and “living”—under
which latter head came slaves: it was want
of faith in human nature. “Who would do the scullion-work
in the great household of humanity if there were
no slaves?” Such was the question which perplexed
the great philosophers of antiquity and which Christ
came to answer by making Himself the slave of mankind
and classing Himself among the scullions. How strangely
dull and unappreciative do those words of Renan sound,
that, if you deduct from what Christ taught, what other
people have taught before Him, little will be left that
is original! “Taught!” It was not the teaching, it was
the doing. Nay, it was not the doing, it was the in-breathing
into mankind of a new Spirit, by means of
doing, that ultimately destroyed slavery. “Even as the
Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to
minister and to give his life a ransom for many”—the
Spirit that dictated these words, dictated also the death
upon the Cross; and this Spirit has destroyed slavery and
will establish true socialism upon earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“But this Spirit of Christ has never been fully obeyed
or even understood by His followers: even St. Paul does
not seem to have understood that Christianity was incompatible
with slavery.” You are quite right. The Spirit of
Christ has never yet been fully obeyed, and, when we thus
obey it, life will be heaven. Do you not see that your
objection ignores the fact that we are not yet in heaven,
and that Christianity is to be a gradual growth? Are you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>not a little like the child who sows his mustard-seed at
night and comes down next morning expecting to see
the great tree in which the birds of the air ought to have
built their nests? The important question is whether
the Christian Spirit so far as it has been obeyed, has
worked well; so that we may trust it to lead us still further
forward into practical ameliorations of our existence,
whether individual or national. But to expect it to do
everything in eighteen hundred years, is to forget all the
teaching of history, astronomy, and geology, three voices
that unite in proclaiming that the Hand of God works
slowly.</p>

<p class='c006'>And further, as to your objection that even St. Paul did
not realize the incompatibility between Christianity and
slavery, what follows from that? Nothing I suppose
except a confirmation of the words in the Fourth Gospel,
that the followers of Christ must not depend entirely upon
St. Paul, but upon that Spirit which shall “guide us into
all truth.” To my mind it is refreshing and delightful to
confess—as I am sure St. Paul himself would have been
the first to confess—that he had not fully realized all the
consequences to which the Spirit of Christ would lead
posterity. I believe that St. Paul wished slaves to take
every lawful opportunity of becoming free, but that he
would by no means have encouraged slaves to run away
or to rise violently against their masters. If he had encouraged
them, and if he had universally succeeded, he
would have caused the whole Empire, all civilized society,
to collapse at once. Was he wrong in not causing this? I
am not prepared to say so. I think he shewed more statesmanlike
and Christian intuition in doing nothing of the
kind. But he did much. He had no slaves of his own,
you may be sure; he worked like a slave all night, that
he might preach all day; he bore fetters like a slave, and
was proud to call himself a slave for the sake of Christ;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>he inveighed against the spirit of slavery, declaring that
in Christ “there is neither bond nor free;” and on the only
occasion that we know of, when he had to mediate in a
practical way between an angry master and a runaway
slave, he sent the man back to his master without conditions
or stipulations, but with a letter that was equivalent
to an emancipation: “For perhaps he was therefore
parted from thee for a season that thou shouldest have him
for ever; no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a
brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to
thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord. If then thou
countest me a partner, receive him as myself.” Was not
this, practically and morally, more efficacious than if the
Apostle had fulminated against the master Philemon fiery
utterances about the rights of man and the incompatibility
between Christianity and slavery? Was not Onesimus more
sure of being emancipated by the quiet apostolic method?
Was not Philemon likely to feel a quickened sense of new
and higher duty when the Spirit of Christ was breathed
into his heart by these touching and affectionate words,
than if a Pauline edict had confronted him with a “Thou
shalt” and “Thou shalt not”? St. Paul’s method has
been the method of the Spirit of Christ: for eighteen
centuries Christ has been saying to men, not “All slavery
is unlawful,” but to each master about each individual
slave, “If then thou countest Me a partner, receive him as
Myself.” Hence by degrees has been shaped a conviction
that slavery in itself is against the will of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the destruction of slavery has not destroyed other
problems of life which still await their solution from
Christian socialism. When men cease to work from
the compulsion of a master, they either give up working,
or they work for some other motive—their own subsistence,
or their own comfort, luxury, avarice, ambition,
the mere pleasure and interest of work, or for the sake of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>others. Are people to give up working? And, if they
work, which of these motives is to take the place of the
old bestial coercion which prevailed in the days of
slavery? These are the great questions of the present,
affecting the happiness, morality, and religion of the
whole human race. True Christians and true socialists
are here at one. “If a man will not work, neither let him
eat” is their answer to the first question; and the more we
can combine to make the drone feel that he is out of place
in the hive, and that he must either conform to the hive’s
ways or betake himself elsewhither, the better will it be
morally, and therefore ultimately better in all respects,
for the inhabitants of the hive. As to the second question,
socialists and moralists agree that each must work
for the sake of others, and, as far as possible, for all.
To my mind, therefore, one of the most hopeful signs of
the times is to be discerned in the spread of the higher
socialist spirit which protests against making competition
the basis of national prosperity. Disguise it as you may,
competition contains an ugly element which was clearly
brought out by its first eulogist, the practical agricultural
Hesiod, who tells us that there are two kinds of strife,
namely, war and competition. The latter, he says, is
good; for it rouses even the sluggard to action, when he
sees his neighbour hastening to wealth:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in13'>“—this strife is good for mortals,</div>
      <div class='line'>And potter <i>envieth</i> potter and carpenter carpenter.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>This is the plain truth. Competition is always in danger
of producing “envy,” and, when it is carried consistently
to its extreme—as where a large manufacturer undersells
and ruins small manufacturers that he may secure
a monopoly—it verges on that other kind of strife which
Hesiod has himself described as “blameful;” it becomes
a kind of war, and is manifestly unchristian. Christianity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>might have been therefore expected to protest against it;
but it has not done so: that task has been reserved for
the informal kind of Christianity called socialism. But
very much more than protest is needed. The problem of
competition and how to dispense with it—or how to restrain
it while remedying its evils—is far more complex
than that of slavery. Some people regard it as an inherent
law of human society, a natural and continuous development
of the law of the struggle for existence which
we have inherited from our remotest ancestry. Others,
while admitting this primæval origin, hope that, as progressive
man has worked out from his nature much else
of the baser element, so he may in time eliminate this
also. But, if any success is to be attained, all sorts of experiments
will have to be tried; all sorts of failures will
have to be encountered; and it may be that in the end
the Pauline method of dealing with slavery may be found
the best means of dealing with competition—not so much
protesting and fulminating, but the earnest, informal action
of individual enthusiasm. Action like St. Paul’s may
prepare the way for legislation; but, without change of
temper, mere legislation cannot permanently help a people
to deal with a great social difficulty.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the solution of the complicated problems presented
by competition, socialism, when severed from Christianity,
labours (1885) under most serious disadvantages. Ignoring
Christ, it reads amiss the whole of the history of the past
and is in danger of making terrible mistakes in the future.
Even where it avoids revolutionary extravagances, it is
tempted to trust far too much to force, moral if not physical
coercion, legislative enactments, and other shapes of what
St. Paul would call “Law.” Looking up to no Leader in
heaven, it does not feel sufficiently sure of ultimate success.
“He that believeth,” says the prophet, “shall not make
haste:” now socialism has no firm basis of belief and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>therefore is disposed to “make haste,” not always the
haste of energy, sometimes the spasmodic haste of self-distrust
and error, followed perhaps by dejection or inaction.
Its neglect of the true religion leads it into political
as well as religious mistakes. Taking too little account
of sentiments, imaginations, and associations, it aims
at a merely material prosperity which, if attained, would
leave the minds of men still vacant and craving more; and
besides, it proceeds by methods which excite alarm and
distrust in many well-wishers. The most serious evil of
all is that the leaders of the socialist movement, if they
themselves see no Leader above them, are actuated by no
sense of loyalty and affection such as Christians should
feel for Christ, and consequently are far more exposed to
the dangers arising from their own individual weaknesses
and shortcomings. Their mainspring of action is a
passionate enthusiasm for poor toiling humanity: but how
if humanity shews itself to them at times in its basest
aspects, ungrateful, suspicious, mean and shabby, timorous
and traitorous, quite unworthy of their devotion? Are they
to serve such a god as this? And it is a perishable god
too; for must not all things perish, and the earth itself
become ultimately as vacant as the moon? For so vile a
master as this, then, are they to endure to be humiliated
and attacked by the rich and powerful, envied and slandered
by rival leaders, occasionally suspected even by the
very poor to whom they are giving their lives? In
moments of depression, when thoughts like these occur—as
occur they must—it is hard indeed for a leaderless
leader of men to refrain from flinging up his task, or
from continuing to pursue it out of mere shame of inconsistency,
or mere love of occupation, excitement, and
power. When that change comes over the tribune of the
poor, all is over with him. His work is done, though he
may have done nothing. Outwardly such a man’s conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>may be little changed, but inwardly his spirit is dead within
him. His religion—for it was a religion to him—is now
dead; and sooner or later his changed influence must make
itself felt in an infection of deadness spreading through
the whole of the multitudes whom he once inspired.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is for these reasons that I look to a simpler form of
Christianity as the future religion of the masses; first
because I see that the most active religious forces of the
present day are already unconsciously following on the
lines traced by Christ’s spirit; and secondly, because these
movements already exhibit a deficiency which the worship
of Christ alone can fill up.</p>

<p class='c006'>The worship of Christ as the type and King of men
helps to solve the problems of the individual as well as
those of the nation. As long as human nature is what it
is, as long as friends and families are parted by death, as
long as the mind is liable to be weighed down by depression,
and the body to be racked by physical pain, so long
will there be hours when we shall all look upward and
demand some other consolation than the commonplace;
“These misfortunes are common to all.” Stripped of all
myth and miracle, the life and death and triumph of Christ
convey to the simplest heart the simplest answer that can
be given to the irrepressible question, “Whence comes this
misery?” From the cross of Christ there is sent back to
each of us this answer, “We know not fully; but our
Leader bore it, and good came of it in the end.” And
when we stand at the brink of the grave and ask, “What
is death?” again the answer comes back from the same
source, “We know not fully; but He passed through it
and He still lives and reigns.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But besides the powerful influence of religion in the
critical and exceptional moments of our lives, the influence
of Christ would come full of strength and blessing to the
working men of England even if they acknowledged Him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>at first, in the most inarticulate of creeds, as the man
whom they admired most: “We used to think that Christ
was a fiction of the priests; at all events not a man like
us in any way; a different sort of being altogether; one
who could do what he liked—so people said—and turn the
world upside down if he pleased: and then we could not
make him out at all. Why, thought we, did he not turn
the world upside down and make it better, if he could? It
was all a mystery to us. But now we find he was a man
after all, like us; a poor working man, who had a heart
for the poor, and wanted to turn the world upside down,
but could not do it at once; and he went a strange way,
and a long way round, to do it; but he has come nearer
doing it, spite of his enemies, than any man we know; and
now that we understand this, we say—though we don’t
understand it all or anything like it—‘He is the man for
us.’” I say that even if this rudimentary feeling of
gratitude and admiration for their great Leader could
possess the hearts of English working men—and this is
surely not too much to expect—much would come from
even this inadequate worship. And, for myself, I unhesitatingly
declare that I would sooner be in the position
of a working man who doubts about Heaven and Hell and
even about God, but can say of Christ, “He is the man for
me,” than I would be in the position of the well-to-do
manufacturer who is persuaded of the reality of Heaven
and Hell and of the truth of all the theology of the
Church of England, but can reconcile his religion with
the deliberate establishment of a colossal fortune on the
ruin of his fellow creatures.</p>

<p class='c006'>But I do not believe that the feeling of the working man
for Jesus of Nazareth could long confine itself to admiration.
It is not so easy to make a happy nation or a happy
world as the working man thinks: and this he will soon
find out. When sanitation, education, culture, science,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>political rearrangements, enlargements for the poor, and
restrictions for the rich, have all done their best and
failed—as they necessarily must fail, unless helped by
something more—then the working man will find what
that “something more” is, without which nothing effectual
can be done. Then he will perceive that, after all, unless
there is a spirit of mutual concession in classes and
individuals, no Acts of Parliament can ever be devised to
secure lasting prosperity and concord. Then he will
awaken to the fact that Jesus of Nazareth revealed and
exemplified that spirit of concession or self-sacrifice, and
that it was by this means that He went as far as He did
toward “turning the world upside down;” and so he will
be gradually led still further to see that the way which He
went was after all not such a very “long way round,” but a
divine way, a way truly worthy of the Son of God. I
believe that the recognition of this single fact would go
further than even the recognition of the marvellous
phenomena which manifested the Resurrection of Christ,
to convince working men that the man who possessed this
sublime intuition into spiritual truth, and the perfect
unselfishness and self-control needful to give effect to his
plans for the raising up of mankind, must be no other than
the Son of God. The rest would follow. They would find
they had been all their lives on a wrong track in their
search after the divine reality; worshipping brute force
while protesting against it; bowing in their hearts to
pomp, and wealth, and high birth, even while they professed
to deride them; despising things familiar and near;
gaping in stupid servile admiration at things far and
unknown; yet all the time God was near them, among
them, in them; the Spirit of God was none other than the
spirit of true socialism; the Son of God was none other
than the poor and lowly Workman of Nazareth.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>Excuse my delay in answering your letter of last
month. The fact is I have not so much leisure as I had.
I was glad indeed to hear from you (last Christmas, I think)
that you could not so lightly put away the worship and
service of Christ as you had felt disposed, or compelled
to do, some eighteen months before; that the question
appeared to you now a deeper one than you had then supposed,
not to be decided by mere historical evidence but,
to some extent, by the experience of life; and that you
were inclined at least so far to take my advice as to wait
a while, to stand in the old ways, and to adhere—so far as
you honestly could—to old religious habits, including the
habit of prayer and attendance at public worship. This
was as much as I could reasonably hope. I could not expect
that a few letters from one who is quite conscious
that he does not possess the strange and sometimes instantaneous
influence exerted by a strong religious character,
would do all that will, I trust, be done for you by patience,
by a prayerful and laborious life devoted to good objects,
and by cherishing habits of reverence for the good, and
of thoughtfulness for all. I had been in the habit of
regularly giving my Sundays, and occasionally some hours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>on week days, to our theological correspondence: but
when I received that announcement from you, I felt that
my time might now be devoted to other objects, and I
made arrangements accordingly. Hence, when your
recent letter reached me, I was not quite at leisure to
reply to it immediately. But you pressed me to answer
“one last question,” which I should rather call two questions
(for they are quite distinct, although you combine
them so closely as to leave me uncertain whether you
recognize the wide difference between them): “Can a
man who rejects the miraculous element in the Bible
remain a member or a minister in the Church of
England?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Your first question I should answer with an unhesitating
affirmative. The Church of England does not require
from its lay members any signature of the Articles or any
test but a profession of belief in the Creed at the time of
baptism, renewed in the Catechism and Confirmation
service; and I cannot think that any sincere worshipper
of Christ ought so far to take offence at one or two expressions
in the Creed—which may be interpreted by him
metaphorically, though by others literally—as to separate
himself on that account from the national church. Grant
that his interpretation may be a little strained, nay, grant
even that he is obliged to say “I cannot believe this;”
yet I should doubt the necessity, or even wisdom and
rightness, of cutting himself off from the Church of England
because of one or two clauses in the Creed, as long as he
feels himself in general harmony with the Church doctrine
and services. There would be no end to schisms, and no
possibility of combining for worship, if every one separated
himself from every congregational utterance with which
he could not heartily agree in every particular. On this
point I find myself obliged to remember for my own sake,
and to apply to myself, the advice I once gave a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>little child many years ago. We were singing a hymn,
and had come to the words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ah me, ah me, that I</div>
      <div class='line'>In Kedar’s tents here stay:</div>
      <div class='line'>No place like that on high,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lord, thither guide my way.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“I suppose,” said the child (who was young but somewhat
old-fashioned in thought and expression), “that these words
mean that you want to die, if they mean anything. But
I don’t want to die. So I don’t think I ought to say
them.” In my own mind I sympathized very much with
the objector; but I endeavoured to meet the objection.
“Hymns,” I said, “are written not for single persons but
for congregations. In a whole churchful you will find all
sorts of people of different ages and ways of thinking.
Some are glad and strong, others sad and weak. Some
rejoice in life and look forward eagerly to labour. These
are mostly the young; but the older sort are sometimes
tired of life and longing for rest. Now when we are singing
a hymn we must all do our best, young and old, happy
and sad, to enter into one another’s feelings, and we must
not expect that every word in every hymn will precisely
represent our own particular feelings at the moment: the
time will perhaps come when the words that now seem
meaningless to us will exactly represent our deepest
feelings, and we shall wonder how we could have ever
failed to feel them; but for the present we must not be
disposed always to be asking, ‘Do I agree with this?
Do I exactly feel that?’ Of course if it occurs to you
that these or those words are so opposite to what you
think, that you would be telling a lie to God in uttering
them, why then you must not utter them: but you ought
not to suppose that in a church service God exacts from
you a rigid account for every word of the congregational
utterances in which you take part: if you can heartily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>join in the greater part of the service, do not be afraid;
He accepts your prayers and praises.” Many years have
passed away since I spoke thus: and, since then, I have
found myself often obliged to repeat to myself, for my
own guidance, the advice which I then gave to guide
another. In a public service one must give and take,
and I see no reason at all why a believer in non-miraculous
Christianity should not find himself in harmony with
the services of the Church of England. His interpretation
both of the Bible and of the Prayer-book will be
different from that of most of the congregation; but he
will accept both the Bible and the Prayer-book as the
best books that could be used for their several purposes,
and would be sorry to see them replaced by anything that
could be devised by himself or by those who think as
he does.</p>

<p class='c006'>So far I can speak confidently; but I am more doubtful
as to the answer that should be given to your second
question, “Can a believer in non-miraculous Christianity
remain a minister in the Church of England?” Looking
at the Articles, if I were forced to assume that every one
of them is binding on a Church of England minister, I
should say that a belief in the miraculous is necessary for
every one who can honestly sign an assent to the Article
on Christ’s Resurrection, which asserts that, “Christ did
truly rise again from death, and took again His body with
flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection
of man’s nature, wherewith He ascended into heaven.”
These words distinctly declare the Resurrection of
Christ’s material body; and as I do not believe in
the fact, I cannot assent to the words, nor do I see how
any believer in non-miraculous Christianity can assent
to them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps you may think, in your innocence, that this
disposes of the question, arguing logically thus: “The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>Church of England appoints certain Articles as tests of
belief for her ministers; A cannot assent to one of these
Articles; therefore A has no right to remain a minister:
there is no loophole out of this logical statement of the
case.” There is not: and if the Church of England were
governed in accordance with logic, I (and a good many
others) ought to have left the ranks of her ministers as
soon as we found that we had been forced to reject a
single clause of a single Article. But the Church has not
been fur several generations governed in this logical way.
Besides practically and generally allowing among its
members a great degree of freedom and latitude, it has
enlarged that latitude during the last generation by a
specific and authoritative alteration of the terms of subscription
to the Articles. When I signed them—which I
did, with perfect honesty and sincerity, some three or four
and twenty years ago—we were obliged to “assent and
consent” to “each and every” Article in each particular:
I forget the exact terms, but I know they were as stringent
as they well could be. But in 1865 the Clerical Subscription
Act introduced a new form:—“I assent to the
Thirty-nine Articles of Religion and to the Book of Common
Prayer.... I believe the doctrine of the Church of
England as therein set forth to be agreeable to the Word
of God.” Now if “therein” meant “in each and every
clause of each and every Article,” that would have been
tantamount to a mere repetition of the old requirement.
Obviously therefore this alteration implies an obligation
of the subscriber to assent, no longer to “each and every
Article” in particular, but to the Articles as a whole,
regarded as an expression of Anglican doctrine. Consequently,
at present, the necessity of subscription need not
repel any one unless he finds himself unable to accept
“the doctrine of the Church of England as set forth,”
not in detail, but generally, in the Articles and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>Prayer-book; and I need not say that a believer in non-miraculous
Christianity by no means occupies a position
of such dissent as this.</p>

<p class='c006'>The only obstacle therefore for a scrupulous minister
will be in the services of the Church and in the reading
of the Bible: and here I admit that there is a very considerable
obstacle, though it appears to me to be less than
it was a dozen years ago, and each year lessens it still
further. The difficulty lies, not in the scepticism of the
minister (who may be a more faithful worshipper of
Christ than any one in his flock) nor in any congregational
suspicion or alarm (for his advanced views lie quite
beyond the horizon of the thoughts of any country congregation,
and any but an exceptional congregation elsewhere)
but almost entirely in the minister’s own uneasy
sense of a difference between himself and his people; in
his fear that he may be acting hypocritically; in his
consequent loss of self-respect; and in a resulting demoralization
affecting all his work.</p>

<p class='c006'>Clearly this is a difficulty which would be diminished,
if not altogether removed, by publicity; but as long as it
is not publicly recognized that widely different interpretations
of the Scripture are possible and compatible with
the worship of Christ, the difficulty is a very serious one.
Whenever such a man reads the Bible in the discharge
of his public duty, he is liable to be haunted with the consciousness
that he is two-faced. He conveys to his congregation
an obvious meaning and they assume that he
accepts that meaning himself; but he does not. Suppose,
for example, he reads the story of the battle of Beth-horon:
his congregation believes that it is listening to the
most stupendous miracle that the world has witnessed;
the minister believes that he is reading an account of one
of the twenty, or more, decisive battles of history. Similarly,
in the New Testament, if he reads the narrative of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>the feeding of the 4,000 or 5,000, he reads it as a religious
legend, curiously preserving a deep spiritual truth, but of
no value except for its emblematic meaning; but his congregation
listens to him as if he were reciting one of the
most important proofs that Jesus was no mere man, but
truly the Son of God. I do not wish to exaggerate the
difference between the rationalizing minister and the
literalizing congregation. Both he and they believe that
in the battle of Beth-horon God was working out the
destiny of Israel and preparing for Himself a chosen
people; both he and they believe that Jesus Christ was
the true Bread of Life; and similarly, as regards many
other miraculous narratives of the Scriptures, the congregation
and the minister, though divided as to the
acceptance of the historical fact, will be united in accepting
the spiritual interpretation which is the essence
of the narrative. Moreover, every year is probably increasing
the number of the laity who take the same
esoteric view as the minister takes about many of the
miracles. In any educated congregation there must
be a large number of men, and there will soon be a large
number of women, who do not believe in the literal
stories of Balaam’s ass, Elisha’s floating axe-head, and
Samson’s exploit with the jaw-bone. Unless educated
people are kept out of our churches, or separate themselves
from the Church, this number must soon increase.
Thus the gulf between the rationalizing minister and the
congregation tends yearly to diminish through the action
of the congregation; and if only both the esoteric and
the exoteric interpretation of the Scripture were generally
recognized as being compatible with the faithful worship
of Christ, I do not see why the minister should not
claim for himself, without any sense of constraint or
insincerity, the same freedom of interpreting the Bible
which is accorded to the laity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>There still remains however the clause in the Creed
stating the Miraculous Conception, which to me appears
the greatest difficulty of all. It is one thing, in my judgment,
to repeat the prayers of the Church and to read
passages from the sacred books of the Church, as the
mouthpiece of the congregation, and rather a different
thing to stand up and say—not only as the mouthpiece
of the congregation, but in your individual character, as a
Christian, and as a priest as well—“I believe this, or
that,” and to take money for so saying; while all the time
you are saying under your breath, “But I only believe it
metaphorically.” Here, again, my scruples would be
removed, if it were only generally understood that the
metaphorical interpretation was possible and permissible.
As regards the Athanasian Creed, for example, I should
have no scruples at all. For the tone and spirit, as well
as for the phraseology, of that Creed, I feel the strongest
aversion. Yet I should repeat it as the mouthpiece of
the congregation without any hesitation, because they
would all know that the Church of England, so far as it
can speak through the archbishops and bishops, has
signified that the repulsive clauses in the Creed may all
be so explained as practically to be explained away. I
do not in the least believe that this mild interpretation of
the damnatory clauses explains their original meaning;
but that matters little or nothing. Provided there be no
suspicion of insincerity, I am willing to make considerable
sacrifices of personal convictions in so complex a rite as
congregational worship. The clergyman whom I most
respect has not read the Athanasian Creed for thirty
years: for my own sake, as a participator in the worship
of his church, I rejoice; but all my respect for him did
not prevent me from doubting sometimes whether he was
right in this matter, until I found that his action had
been prompted by an expression of feeling on the part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>some representative members of his congregation. For
if one clergyman is justified in omitting the Athanasian
Creed whenever he likes, I do not see why another is not
justified in reading it whenever he likes: the liberty of the
clergy might easily become the slavery of the laity. I
should therefore be ready to read the repugnant Athanasian
Creed because every member of my congregation
would know (and I should feel justified in letting them
know from the pulpit) that I read it in obedience to the
law and in spite of my convictions. But I am not so
ready, at present, to read the Apostles’ Creed or Nicene
Creed, although I cordially accept them except so far as
concerns the one word which expresses the Miraculous
Conception. My reason is, that I should not like to
leave my congregation under the impression that I accepted
that dogma, and on the other hand I should not
feel justified in using a pulpit of the National Church
to explain why I rejected it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here again, as in the previous instance, I feel that times
are rapidly changing, and the freedom of ministers in the
Church of England is rapidly increasing. For scruples as
to the use of the Creeds, no less than for scruples as to the
reading of the Scriptures, publicity is the chief remedy
wanting to dissipate scruples; and time is on the side of
freedom. Belief in miracles now rests on an inclined
plane; friction is daily lessening, the downward motion is
rapidly increasing; in a few more years the authorities of
the Church of England may recognize, not with reluctance
but with delight, that there are some young men who
know enough of Greek, and of history, and of evidence,
to be convinced that the miracles are unhistorical, and
who, nevertheless, are worshippers of Christ on conviction,
with a faith not to be shaken by anything that science
or criticism can discover, and with a readiness to serve
Christ, as ministers in the English Church, if they can do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>so without sacrifice of their opinions and without suspicion
of insincerity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Personally, I have not felt these scruples very acutely.
Circumstances have placed me where nothing has been
required of me which might not have been done as well
by a Nonconformist as by a member of the Church of
England. To help a friend, or do occasional work in an
unofficial way, has never caused me the least misgiving;
for I have always remained in cordial accord with the
forms of worship current in the Church of England. The
only difference that my views have made in my clerical
action has been this, that I have preferred for a time not
to place myself in any position where ministerial work
might officially be required of me. Yet even these
scruples have been doubtfully entertained, and would
vanish altogether if ever I were to publish a volume of
such letters as I am now writing to you, so that I could
be sure that my opinions were no secret from my Bishop
and from such members of my congregation as were likely
to understand them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The advice which I have given to myself, I should
also be inclined to give to others who are already ministers
in the Church of England, and who have scruples of conscience
in consequence of some divergence from orthodox
views: “Stay where you are, as long as you feel that
you can sincerely worship Christ as the Eternal Son of
God, and as long as you can preach a gospel of faith
and strength, not only from the pulpit but also by the
bedside of the dying. If you can do this, you may
stay, though you are obliged to interpret metaphorically
some expressions in the Creed. If you cannot do this,
go at once, even though you can accept every syllable
in all the Creeds in the most literal sense.”</p>

<p class='c006'>To young men who have not yet been ordained and
who incline to “rational” views of Christianity, I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>been disposed hitherto to give different advice: “Wait
a while. The fashion of men’s opinion is rapidly changing;
the excessive fear of science on the part of the Clergy—many
of whom come from Public Schools where they have
received no training in the rudiments of science or
mathematics—is, strange to say, predisposing all but extreme
High Churchmen to welcome the adhesion of any
who are firm believers in Christ, even though they may
doubt or reject the miracles. It would be a miserable
thing to be ordained, and to undertake the task of preaching
a doctrine implying the highest conceivable morality,
and presently to find yourself condemned by those to
whom you should be an example as well as an instructor,
for what appears to them patent insincerity—condemned
by others, and perhaps not wholly acquitted by yourself.
In a few years you may perhaps find it possible to be ordained
not upon tolerance but with a hearty reception, and
then there need be no concealment of your opinions.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the language that I have hitherto used on the
very few occasions when I have been consulted, generally
advising delay. But now I am inclined to think that the
time has come when young men with these opinions ought
not to wait, but ought at least to set their case before the
Bishops, leaving it to them to accept or refuse them as
candidates for ordination. Schisms and prosecutions are
very objectionable things, but there are worse evils even
than these. There is the danger of hypocrisy, spreading,
like an infection, from oneself to others. The hour has
perhaps come for authorizing or condemning the extreme
freedom of opinion which some of the Broad Churchmen
have assumed. Proverbs and texts might be quoted in
equal abundance to justify action or inaction in the abstract;
but two important practical considerations appear
to me to dictate some kind of action without delay.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the one hand, we hear the complaint that the ablest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>and most conscientious men are deterred by scruples from
entering the ministry in the Church of England, even
when they feel a strong bent for clerical work. If this
scarcity of able candidates for ordination continues for
many more years, we shall have bad times in store for us.
Already I think I have noted, among some ministers who
are conscious of but little intellectual and not much more
spiritual power, a disposition unduly to magnify their
office, the ritual, the mechanical use of the sacraments,
parochial machinery, processions, sensational hymns,
church salvation-armies, and church-routine generally,
because they feel they have no evangelic message of their
own, no individual inspiration. In some degree, such a
subordination of self is good and may argue modesty;
but in many cases it is not good, when it leads young men
to materialize and sensualize religion, to suppose that the
preaching of Christ’s Gospel and the elevation of the souls
of men can be effected by ecclesiastical battalion drill; to
dispense with study, thought, and observation; to acquiesce
in the letter of the collected dogmas of the past, and to
hope for no new spiritual truth from the progress of the
ages controlled by the ever fresh revelations of the Spirit
of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other hand, there is the opposite evil, on which
I have already touched—I mean the danger that some of
the more intellectual among the clergy, those who do not
sympathize with sacerdotalism and are popularly reckoned
among the “Broad Church,” may not only be suspected
of insincerity in professing to believe what they, as a fact,
disbelieve, but may also become actually demoralized by
self-suspicions and hence indirectly demoralize their congregations.
I confess my sympathies are very much with
a man in that position. He has been sometimes the victim
of cruel circumstances. In his youth, the religious problems
of the present day lay all in the background. Before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>he was ordained, he may very well have discerned no
difficulties at all in the career before him, nothing but
the prospect of a noble work, to which he felt himself
called. His life was probably spent in a public boarding-school,
where he scarcely ever had a minute to himself
for thought and meditation; it being the ideal of the
educator so to engross the time and energy of each pupil
in studies or in games that the average youth might be
kept out of moral mischief and the clever youth might get
a scholarship at Oxford or Cambridge. When he came
to the University he found himself expected to devote
himself to “reading for a degree,” and there was little or
no time for theology; after taking his degree he found
himself under the necessity of earning his living, and if
he was intending to become a clergyman he naturally
desired to be ordained as soon as possible. If he was very
fortunate, he may have contrived (as I did) to get a year’s
reading at theology while he supported himself by taking
pupils; but that was probably the utmost of his preparation.
Soon after reaching his twenty-third year he was
ordained. And now, for the first time, leaving school and
college, he begins to realize what life means, and to think
for himself. Can we wonder that this “thinking for
himself” produces considerable changes of thought? If
he is healthy, and active in his parish, and has not much
time for reflection and reading, the changes will be long
deferred, and he will be scarcely conscious of them: but
if he has any mind at all in him, and gives it the least
exercise, it is hardly possible that an able and honest
student of the Bible at the age of forty-six, when he comes
to compare the opinions of his manhood with those of his
youth, will not find that he has ceased to believe, or at all
events to be certain of, the historical accuracy of a good
deal which he accepted with unquestioning confidence at
the age of twenty-three.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>Changes of this kind are inevitable, and they ought not
to be feared. Yet perhaps the fear of them deters some
of the more thoughtful young men from presenting themselves
for ordination. They know that they believe in
such and such facts now, but, say they, “Many sincere
and thoughtful persons dispute the truth of these facts;
and what will be my position some ten years hence if I find
that I am driven to deny what I now affirm?” What
one would like to be able to reply, in answer to such an
appeal, would be, that the worship of Christ does not
depend upon the truth of a few isolated and disputable
pieces of evidence, but upon the testimony of the conscience
based upon indisputable (though complex) evidence;
so that, if the man’s conscience remains the same,
he need not fear lest the fundamental principles of his
faith will be shaken by any historical or scientific criticism.
From the terrestrial point of view, Christ is human
nature at its divinest. Whoever therefore in the highest
degree loves and trusts and reveres human nature at its
divinest, he naturally worships a representation of Christ,
even though he may never have heard of the name.
Now life will bring a young man many disappointments
and disillusions and paradoxes: but no one, who has
once worshipped Christ in this natural way, need fear (or
hope?) that life will ever bring him anything more worthy
of representing human nature at its divinest, anything
therefore more worthy of worship, than Jesus of Nazareth.
The only danger is, that one may cease to be able to love
and trust and revere the objects that deserve these feelings.
There is indeed that danger, just as there is the danger
that one may cease to be able to be honest. But what
young man, in mapping out his future, would make insurance
against such a moral paralysis? A man ought
no more—a man ought still less—to contemplate the
possibility of becoming unable to worship Christ, than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>the possibility of becoming unable to revere a kind father
or love affectionate children. If then our candidate for
ordination regards Christ in this spirit, one would like to
encourage him to present himself for ordination even
though he may already doubt the Biblical narrative
on some points, and though he may be pretty certain
that he will change his mind on many others by
the time he is twice as old as he is now. However it
rests very much with Bishops to settle this question; and
the question as to what the Bishops might do is so
important as to demand a separate letter.</p>
<p class='c005'>P.S. Since writing the above remarks about the reluctance
of the ablest men at the Universities to be ordained,
I have been told that the state of things is even worse than
I had conceived at Cambridge. There, at the two largest
colleges, Trinity and St. John’s, I am told that of the
Fellows who took their degrees between 1873-9 only eight,
out of sixty or thereabouts, took holy orders; and of those
who took degrees between 1880-6, only three out of sixty.
Trinity is conspicuous; of the sixty Fellows who took
degrees from 1873-86 only two have been ordained.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>
  <h2 id='let31' class='c004'>XXXI <br /> WHAT THE BISHOPS MIGHT DO</h2>
</div>
<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>My dear ——</span>,</p>

<p class='c006'>I reminded you in my last letter that ordination or
non-ordination must largely depend upon the judgment of
the Bishops. This, I suppose, must have always been the
case to some extent: but there are reasons why it may
well be so now to a greater extent than before. The
important change made in the form of subscription to the
Thirty-nine Articles has supplied a solid and definite
ground upon which the Bishops may fairly claim to
ascertain from candidates for ordination some details
about their religious opinions. In the times when candidates
had to assent to every point in every Article, no
further examination was necessary: but now that the
candidate is allowed (by implication) to dissent from some
things in the Articles, the Bishop may surely, without
any inquisitorial oppression, say: “Before I ordain you,
I should like to know, in a general way, how far your
dissent from the Articles extends.” Some Bishops may
be inclined to shrink from such an interrogation, as
though it implied doubt of the candidate’s sincerity: and
of course such an examination might be abused in a
narrow or bigoted or even tyrannical manner. But on the
whole, I think, it might be even more useful as a protection
and help to the young candidate than to the
Bishop. Here and there, perhaps, a young man might
be advised to give up, or defer, the prospect of ordination;
but others (who would have otherwise been deterred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>by scruples) might be encouraged to be ordained in spite
of some intellectual difficulties; and this fatherly encouragement
from a man of authority and experience would be
a great help and comfort, strengthening the young man in
the conviction that mere intellectual difficulties could not
interfere with his faith in Christ. Still more valuable
would be the young man’s consciousness that he could
not be called insincere or hypocritical, since he had concealed
nothing from the Bishop, who, after hearing all,
had decided that there was nothing to exclude him from
ordination.</p>

<p class='c006'>I would therefore advise any man who desired to be
ordained but was deterred by present scruples or the fear
of future scruples, to write at an early period to the Bishop
at whose hands he would be likely to seek ordination,
stating his difficulties frankly and fully, and asking
whether they would be considered an impediment. If he
felt any touch of doubt on the subject of the miracles, I
would have him make them the subject of a special
question. In some dioceses I should expect the answer
to be unfavourable. From others perhaps the answer
would come that the Bishop was “unwilling to undertake
so heavy a responsibility; each man must decide for
himself whether he can honestly read the services of the
Church and the lessons from the Scriptures without
believing in miracles.” That answer would be, in my
judgment, regrettable, though not unnatural or indefensible.
But even that answer would be of value, as it
would be a record that, at all events, the Bishop had not
been kept in ignorance of anything that the candidate
ought to have revealed to him: and this in itself would be
of great value in lightening for a scrupulous and self-introspective
young man the burden of the questions
which might sometimes arise in his mind as he read
aloud in the congregation the words of the Bible or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>Prayer-book. Moreover, I should anticipate that every year
would see an increase in the number of those dioceses
from which a still more favourable answer might be
returned: “If with all your heart you worship Christ as
the Eternal Son of God, if you can honestly and sincerely
accept the Church services as excellent (though imperfect)
expressions of congregational worship; and the Scriptures
as super-excellent (though imperfect) expressions of spiritual
fact; if you feel that you have a message of good
news for the poor and simple as well as for the rich and
educated, and that you can preach the spiritual truths
which you and all of us recognize to be the essence of
the Gospel, without attacking those material shapes in
which, for many generations to come, all spiritual truths
must find expression for the vast majority of Christians,
then I can encourage you to come to the ministry of Christ.
I myself am of the old school and believe in the miracles,
or if not in all, at all events in most; but I recognize that
this belief—though to me it seems safer and desirable—is
not essential: come therefore to the ministry, with the
miracles if you can, without them if you cannot.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Here indeed is a reasonable criterion of fitness for
ordination: and if a man cannot satisfy this, I do not
see how he can complain of being excluded. But no
other criterion seems likely to be permanently tenable.
For imagine yourself to be a Bishop, trying to lay down
some short, precise, and convenient test, as regards the
belief in the miraculous: where are you to draw the line?
A young man, eminently fit in all respects for ministerial
work, comes to you and says that he accepts all the
miracles but one; he cannot bring himself to believe that
Joshua stopped the movement of the sun (or earth).
What are you to do? Reject him? Surely not: not
even though you were Canon Liddon, raised (as I hope he
will be raised) to the episcopal bench. The Universities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>would join in protest against your bigotry; the whole
of educated society would secede from the Church on
such conditions: the masses of non-Christian and semi-Christian
working men would cry out that such a rejection
was a portent of tyranny, and that the men who could
accept admission to the priesthood on such terms as these
were no better than superstitious dolts and slaves,
creatures to be suppressed in a free country! Well,
then, you admit him: will you reject his younger brother
next year, who finds that he cannot accept the miracle of
Balaam’s ass speaking with a human voice? Certainly
you will admit him too. And now where are you to
stop? If you admit a man who denies two miracles, will
you accept a man who denies a third, say, the miracle of
Elisha’s floating axe-head? And if three, why not four?
why not five? and so on to the end of the list?</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, a man comes to you and says that he feels
obliged to reject as an interpolation—although willing to
read them as part of an erroneous but long cherished
tradition—the well-known words at the end of the Lord’s
Prayer, “for thine is the kingdom, the power and the
glory, for ever and ever:” what will you do to him?
Refuse him? Surely not. The Revisers of the New
Testament have themselves rejected the addition, and
I am quite sure no scholar who valued God’s Word, and
certainly no Bishop, would wish to reject a man for preferring
the New Version of the Bible to the Old. But, if
you admit him, what are you to say to his companion,
who rejects also the last twelve verses of St. Mark’s
Gospel? In my opinion, a man must be, Hellenistically
speaking, an “idiot,”—a Greek “idiot,” what the Greeks
call <i>idiotès</i>—to believe in their genuineness. But even
though you, being a busy Bishop, may have forgotten a
good deal of Greek, you cannot forget the decision of the
Revisers. For here again the Revisers are on the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>man’s side. They have printed this passage as a kind of
Appendix, placing an interval between it and the Gospel,
and appending this note: “The two oldest Greek MSS.
and some older authorities, omit from verse 9 to the end.
Some other authorities have a different ending to the
Gospel.” Now if you admit the rejecter of these two
passages, will you refuse his companion, who tells you
he is compelled to agree with the Revisers also as to a
third passage, John vii. 53—viii. 11, where the Revised
Version brackets several verses, adding this note, “Most
of the ancient authorities omit John vii. 53—viii. 11.
Those which contain it vary much from each other”?
You must certainly accept him. But if you accept him,
what are you to say to young men who go further and
reject whole books of the New Testament, for example,
the Second Epistle of St. Peter; the genuineness of
which has been impeached by a great consent of authorities,
and concerning which Canon Westcott says that it
is the “one exception” to the statement that the combined
canons of the Eastern and Western Churches would
produce “a perfect New Testament”? And if we let
him pass, under Canon Westcott’s wing, how shall we
deal with the next candidate, who reminds us that
Luther rejected the Apocalypse and the Epistle of St.
James, and declares that he cannot help agreeing with
Luther? What lastly is to be the fate of those who avow
that they cannot shut their eyes to the traces, even in the
Synoptic Gospels, of considerable interpolations or late
traditions, especially in those portions which contain
miraculous narrative? Perhaps we might feel inclined
to say, “We will take our stand on Westcott and Hort’s
text, or on the text of the Revised Version, and will
refuse any candidate who rejects a word of the New
Testament that is contained in either of these texts; the
line must be drawn somewhere, and we will draw it there.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>What! Shall we reject a candidate for ordination because
he does not accept the Gospel according to Westcott
and Hort, or the Gospel according to an unauthorized
though scholarly knot of men called the Revisers?
Impossible! all Christendom would cry shame upon us.
On the whole, we seem driven to the conclusion
that no candidate for Anglican ordination can be reasonably
rejected for believing that parts of the Bible are
spurious or un-historical, provided that he is willing
to read in the presence of the congregation the portions
of Scripture appointed by the Church.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the test of miracles fails, and if the test of an infallible
book fails, so too does failure await the test of
an infallible Creed. It would be, at all events, departing
strangely from the spirit of the Reformers and from the
spirit of the Articles, to allow men laxity as regards the
interpretation of the Scriptures, which are regarded as
specially inspired, and yet to pin them to the letter of the
Creeds, which are regarded as being authoritative because
they are based on the Scriptures. If a candidate were to
tell you, his Bishop, that “he accepted the Resurrection
of Christ, and even of Christ’s body, but that he could not
honestly say that Christ rose on the third day; for Christ
was buried on the evening of Friday, and rose early on
the morning of Sunday, that is to say, on the second day,”
you would perhaps reason with him, and say that it was
the Jewish way of reckoning; and if he were then to
reply to you that to the greater part of the congregation
this way of reckoning was unknown, and that the phrase
might therefore convey a false impression—what would
you say to this ultra-conscientious young man? This
probably: that “the Creeds of Christendom could not be
disturbed on account of the eccentricities of well-meaning
individuals; that, if this was his only obstacle, you, his
Bishop, could take upon yourself to justify him in repeating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>these words as the mouthpiece of the congregation;
that it was quite open to him to explain the true meaning
of the words from the pulpit; and that little misunderstandings
of this kind, if indeed there was danger of any,
were insignificant as compared with belief in the essential
fact that Jesus rose from the dead.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When the young man goes out—probably satisfied, unless
he is very obstinate, and you a little impatient—let
us suppose that another man comes in, with a different
objection to the same clause. He accepts the essential
fact that Jesus rose from the dead, and he does not object
to the words, “the third day,” but he does not believe
that the material body of Jesus rose from the tomb. He
believes that Jesus Himself, that is to say, His spirit,
rose from the dead, and that He manifested Himself to
His disciples in a spiritual body, which, in accordance
with some law of our human spiritual nature, was manifested
to those, and only to those, who loved Him or
believed in Him.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a> This is a more serious objection by
far: for you have to consider, first, whether the young
man is likely to hold fast his belief in the spiritual
Resurrection of Jesus, when based on such evidence as
this; and secondly whether he can preach the Gospel of
the risen Saviour without raising all sorts of questions
and difficulties in minds unprepared to grapple with them.
At this point, then, I cannot blame your episcopal judgment
if you take time to decide, and if, before deciding,
you do your best to ascertain what manner of man you
have to deal with, and, in particular, whether his stability
is equal to his ability. “Doubts and difficulties” may
sometimes betoken, not so much a mind that thinks for
itself, as a disposition to affect singularity and to strain
after constant novelty. But if you are satisfied on this
point, I think you would do well to admit him to ordination.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>I would not exclude from the ministry any one who
can conscientiously worship Christ in accordance with
the services of the Church of England, and preach the
Gospel without shaking the faith of the masses.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps I shall seem to you (not now in the temporary
episcopal capacity which you have occupied during the
last few paragraphs, but as plain ——) very illiberal
in excluding from the broad boundaries of the National
Church those who are unable to worship Christ. But I
am not prepared to alter the Nicene Creed or the Church
Services; and if I could not worship Christ, I cannot
think that I myself should desire to be included in the
Church of England, as long as that Creed and the Church
Services remained in use. For how could I offer prayer
to Jesus? or say, in any sense, “I believe in Jesus
Christ, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very
God”? No plea of metaphor would ever enable me to
repeat these words with any honesty, as long as I found
myself unable to worship Christ. I confess to a secret
feeling that many of those who at the present time think
they do not worship Christ, do in reality worship Him;
and I have good hopes that some of them may, in time,
when they search out their deepest feelings, find out that
they have long been unconsciously worshipping Him, and
that they can accept, with a spiritual interpretation, some
things that have hitherto appeared to them inadmissible.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
But to demand that the Creeds and Church Services may
be remoulded, is a very different thing from asking to
be allowed to put a metaphorical interpretation on one or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>two phrases in them. When Parochial Councils are established,
it may be found ultimately possible to give some
larger latitude in the modification or multiplication of
Services so as to make them more inclusive: but, after
all, congregations meet for worship, not for the sake of
being liberal and inclusive; and the inclusion of non-worshippers
of Christ can hardly be demanded from a
Church that worships Christ. Nor must the inclusion
of “advanced thinkers” be carried to such an extent as
to exclude the great mass of ordinary believers.</p>

<p class='c006'>I myself, deeply though I sympathize in all essential
matters with the Church of England, should nevertheless
be willing not only to be excluded from it, but
also to see excluded all who may take the same views
as I take, rather than that the simple faith in Christ
entertained by the great body of Christians should be
injured by the premature disruption of those material
beliefs and integumentary illusions with which, at present,
their spiritual beliefs are inseparably connected. And
this brings me to another side of the question. If I were
publishing an appeal to the Bishops, I should certainly
add an appeal to the younger Broad Church clergy.
It ought not to be asking too much from a young
preacher who is an “advanced thinker,” to remember that
some reverence is due to the simpler members of his
flock. Many of those whom he authoritatively instructs are
older, wiser at present, of larger experience in life, some
of them perhaps more spiritually minded, than he is.
What if their deepest and most cherished religious convictions,
right in the main, are tied to certain expressions
and narratives that may not be historically accurate?
Does it follow that their feelings are to be outraged
at any moment by assaults upon the ancient forms
and expressions of their belief from the lips of a young
man who professes to accept these forms, and takes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>money of the Church for accepting them? Such attacks
upon the forms are at present worse than useless, because
they are sure to be construed into attacks upon the
spirit. In time a change will come, and even now a
minister may do something to prepare the way for the
change. He may institute Bible lectures to which he
may invite the attendance of those alone who wish to
study the Bible critically, and those whose reading and
attainments qualify them to criticize, or to follow criticism.
But, from the pulpit, matter of this kind should be
altogether excluded.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nor need the preacher fear lest such restriction should
shackle his liberty and take the life out of his sermons.
In almost every case one invariable rule can be laid
down which will give ample scope to him and no offence
to his hearers: “Always preach what you believe to be
true, and never go out of your way in order to attack
what you believe to be untrue.” For example, your flock
believes that Christ’s body (the tangible body) was raised
from the grave; you do not. Well then, do not attack
their material belief; but preach your spiritual belief.
Teach them that Christ’s Resurrection implies a real
though invisible triumph over the invisible enemy death;
a real, though invisible, sitting at the right hand of God;
a real, though invisible, presence in the heart of every
one who loves and trusts Him. Thus you may teach the
habit of reverence, simultaneously with the habit of
inquiry; a love of the old forms, combined with a still
deeper love of the new truths that may be discovered
beneath them; thus you will not shake the faith of a
single child; you will be impressing upon all alike unadulterated,
precious truth without sacrificing a little of
your own convictions; and at the same time you will be
insensibly preparing the younger portion of your flock
to detach the material part of their belief from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>spiritual, and to retain the latter when the time may
come that shall force them to give up the former. In a
similar spirit you should deal with the Ascension and the
Incarnation, not pointing out the difficulties involved in
the material belief of those dogmas, nor saying a word
to disparage those who believe in them, but doing your
utmost to bring out the spiritual truths and invisible
processes which are represented by those dogmas.
Surely such a self-restraint as this is not more than
may fairly be demanded from any honourable man, I
will not say from a Christian, but from a gentleman.
Your congregation are in their own parish church; they
are bound by conventional respect and by deeply-rooted
reverence for tradition and for the House of God,
not to manifest any such open disapprobation of your
teaching as would be freely permissible at a public meeting;
you are their servant, and the servant, the paid
servant, of the National Church; and yet you have
them at your mercy while you stand in the pulpit.
Profound consideration may fairly be expected from
you for their prejudices, as you may please to call
them; and all the more because they are, as it were, in
possession of the church, while you are an innovator,
holding what must—at all events for some time to come—appear
to the multitude an entirely new doctrine: they
“stand on the old ways.”</p>

<p class='c006'>If the teachers of natural or non-miraculous Christianity
could be trusted to preach in this spirit, they might, I think,
do a good work as ministers in the Church of England,
without injury to themselves, and with much advantage to
the nation. If not, they must come out of the Church for
the purposes of teaching; and that, I fear, would result in
mischief both for the Church and for the State. I believe
that not a few of the educated clergy are either suspending
their belief about miracles, or have decided against them;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>and if these were suddenly to be banished, or gradually to
drop out of the clerical ranks without receiving any successors
of their way of thinking, the gulf would be widened
between the clergy and the educated laity. The men who
might discover new religious truth and prepare the way for
new religious development, having henceforth to earn their
living in other ways, would find little leisure for critical
study. The end would be that the nation would be for a
time divided between superstition and agnosticism; and
sober religion would go to the wall.</p>

<p class='c006'>Not indeed that the destinies of the Gospel of Christ
are to be supposed to be permanently determinable by the
fate of a fraction of the Broad Church section of the
English clergy! The attraction of the natural worship of
Christ—strange, nay, impossible though it may seem when
first presented to the miracle-craving mind—is far too
great to admit the possibility of its ultimate failure. But
first there must come a vast and depressing defection on
the part of those nominal Christians who have hitherto
worshipped Christ on the basis of an infallible Church,
or on the basis of an infallible Book, or on the basis of
indisputable Miracles. Perhaps this collapse will be precipitated
by the discovery of a copy of some Gospel of the
first century, turned up when Constantinople is evacuated
by the Turks. You cannot have forgotten how this year
(1885) the educated religious world in England held
its breath in horrible suspense when the correspondent
of the <i>Times</i> telegraphed that among the Egyptian manuscripts
recently purchased by an Austrian arch-duke, there
had been disinterred a fragment belonging to a Gospel
preceding, and differing from, any now extant. From this
terrible discovery orthodoxy was delivered, for this once,
by the learning of Professor Hort: but who shall guarantee
that a Professor Hort shall be able, or even willing, to
deny the proto-evangelic claims of the next-discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>manuscript from the East? And then, what will become
of some of us!</p>

<p class='c006'>In any case, with or without such discoveries, the
present word-faith, and book-faith, and authority-faith in
the Lord Jesus, must sooner or later collapse; and people
must be driven to the conclusion that the Lord Jesus Himself
must somehow be worshipped through Himself—Jesus
through the Spirit of Jesus, that Spirit which is apparent
in families and nations and Churches as well as in the
New Testament, the Spirit of Love whence springs that
mutual helpfulness which in the New Testament we call
“fellowship” and in the newspapers “socialism.” This
and this alone will help us to apply our science to settle
land questions, Church questions, and war questions, policy
domestic and foreign, and to establish concord in the
world, the nation, and the human heart. I do not say that
a time will ever come when there will be no obstacles to
faith in Christ. Moral obstacles will still exist to make faith
difficult: but some at least of the intellectual difficulties
by which we now shut ourselves out from Christian hope
will then be dissipated. <i>Odium theologicum</i> will become
meaningless. There will have arrived at last that blessed
time, predicted (1603) by Francis Bacon (shall we say just
three hundred years too soon?), bringing with it “the consumption
of all that can ever be said in controversies
of religion;” and henceforth there will be no “controversies,”
only discussions and discoveries.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then, with its mind freed from superstitious terrors and
full of an unquenchable hope, the human race, owning its
allegiance to the Eternal Goodness, and accepting as its
captain the Working Man of Nazareth, will address itself
steadily to the work of Christian socialism, honouring
and encouraging labour without unwise and spasmodic
pampering of it, dishonouring and discouraging idleness
without unwise and direct recourse to forcible suppression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>of it; remembering always that, as the ideal Working
Man was subject to law, so must they be subject to law,
and as He bore suffering for the good of others, so
must they be prepared to suffer as well as to work. This
is true socialism and this is true Christianity. Do you
deny it, and say, “This is not the Christianity that has
been current for eighteen centuries”? I reply, Perhaps
not; and, if it is not, we can call it by some other name.
You remember the saying of Lessing, that after eighteen
centuries of Christianity, it was high time to try Christ.
Let us then amend our phrase and say that true socialism
will not be “the Christian religion” but something better.
It will be the Christian Spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>We are taught by our Scriptures that it has been sometimes
God’s method to teach the wise in this world by
means of those whom the world calls foolish, and the
strong and the rich in this world by those whom the world
calls weak and poor. If history is thus to repeat itself, it
may be reserved for the semi-Christian or non-Christian
working man, for the heretic or agnostic socialist, to guide
orthodox and religious England into a higher and purer
and more spiritual form of Christianity. Yet on the other
hand, since intellectual movements come often from above,
though moral movements come from below, I cannot give
up the hope that it may be reserved for the clergy of the
Church of England to do something towards the removal
of those merely intellectual difficulties which are at
present keeping multitudes of the workers, and not a few
of the thinkers, in our country, from recognizing their
true Deliverer.</p>

  <h2 id='definitions' class='c004'>DEFINITIONS</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c013'>i. Reality</h3>
<p class='c016'>1. <i>Absolute reality cannot be comprehended by men, and
can only be apprehended as God or in God by a
combination of Desire and Imagination, to which
we give the name of Faith.</i></p>

<p class='c015'>2. <i>Among objects of sensation those are (relatively)
real which present similar sensations in similar
circumstances.</i></p>
<h3 class='c013'>ii. Force</h3>
<p class='c005'>“Imagined” is inserted, throughout these Definitions,
as a reminder that the existence of all these objects
of definition, however real, is suggested to us by the
Imagination.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Force is that which is imagined to immediately produce,
or tend to produce, motion.</i></p>

<p class='c012'>Why “immediately”? Because a particle of “matter”—attracting,
as it does, every other particle of “matter”—may
be said to “tend to produce motion.” Yet “matter”
is not said to <i>be</i> force, but to “<i>exert</i>” force. “Matter”
is imagined to attract “matter” through the medium of
force, or “mediately.” But force is imagined to act
“immediately.” Hence the insertion of the word.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>iii. Cause and Effect</h3>
</div>
<p class='c016'><i>When one thing is imagined to produce, or tend to
produce, a second, the first is called the Cause of
the second, and the second the Effect of the first.</i></p>
<h3 class='c013'>iv. Spirit</h3>
<p class='c016'><i>Spirit, i.e. Breath or Wind, is a metaphorical name—implying
subtleness, invisibility, ubiquitousness and
life-giving power—given to the ultimate Cause of
Force; and hence sometimes to the Cause of beneficent
Force in the Universe, i.e. God; sometimes to the
Cause of Force in the human individual; more
rarely to the Cause or Causes of maleficent Forces
in the Universe.</i></p>
<h3 class='c013'>v. Matter</h3>
<p class='c005'>The existence of Matter has never been proved; and
it is nothing but a hypothesis. All the phenomena called
“material” might be explained, without Matter, by the
hypothesis of a number of centres of force. The <i>raison
d’être</i> of Matter is the notion of tangibility. But scientific
men now tell us that no atom ever touches another.
If this be so, scientific tangibility disappears and the
<i>raison d’être</i> of Matter disappears, with it. But it is so
natural a figment that we shall all probably talk about
it, and most of us probably will believe in it, until human
nature is very much changed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Matter cannot be defined positively except by repeating,
in some disguise, the word to be defined, as thus:—</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Material, or Matter, is a name given to an unascertained
and hypothetical “material,” “matter,”</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>“<i>substance,” or “fundamental stuff,” of which we
commonly imagine all objects of sensation to be
composed.</i></p>
<h3 class='c013'>vi. Nature</h3>
<p class='c016'>1. <i>Nature means sometimes the (1) ordinary, or (2) orderly
course of things apart from the present and direct
intervention of human Will; sometimes the (3)
ordinary or (4) orderly course of humanity; sometimes
the (5) ordinary or (6) orderly course of all
things.</i></p>

<p class='c015'>2. <i>Law of Nature is a metaphorical name for a frequently
observed sequence of phenomena (apart from human
Will) implying, to some minds, regularity; to
others, absolute invariability.</i></p>

<p class='c015'>3. <i>Miracle means a supposed suspension of a Sequence,
or Law, of Nature; Marvel, or Mighty Work,
means a rare Sequence of Nature, in which great
Effects are produced by Causes seemingly, but not
really, inadequate.</i></p>

<p class='c015'>4. <i>“Supernatural” is the name given, in these letters,
to the existence of a God; and to His creation and
continuous development of all things: the divine
action being regarded, not as contrary to Nature,
but as above Nature; not as suspending the
sequences of Nature, but as originating and
supporting them.</i></p>
<h3 class='c013'>vii. Will</h3>
<p class='c016'><i>The Will is the power of giving to some one of our
desires, or to some one group of compatible desires,
permanent predominance over the rest.</i></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>An addition might be suggested: “the power of controlling
our desires.” But we appear never to control our
desires except by enthroning some one desire (or group
of desires)—whether it be the desire to gain power, to
ruin an enemy, to do right, or to serve God.</p>
<h3 class='c013'>viii. Attention</h3>
<p class='c016'><i>Attention is the power by which we impress upon our
mind that which is present.</i></p>
<h3 class='c013'>ix. Memory</h3>
<p class='c016'><i>Memory is the power by which we retain or recall
to our mind that which is past.</i></p>
<h3 class='c013'>x. Imagination</h3>
<p class='c016'><i>Imagination is the power by which we combine or
vary the mental images retained by Memory, often
with a view to finding some unity in them; and by
which we are enabled to image forth the future
through anticipating its harmony with the past
and present.</i></p>
<h3 class='c013'>xi. Reason</h3>
<p class='c016'><i>Reason (or, as some prefer to call it in this limited
sense, Understanding) is the power by which we
compare, and, from our comparisons, draw inferences
or conclusions. By means of it we compare
the suggestions of the Imagination with the suggestions
of Experience, and accept or reject the former
in accordance with the result of our comparison.</i></p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>xii. Hope</h3>
</div>
<p class='c016'><i>Hope is desire, of which we imagine the fulfilment,
while recognizing the presence of doubt.</i></p>
<h3 class='c013'>xiii. Faith</h3>
<p class='c005'>The following Definition appears to me to be the basis
of all theology. It is no more than an emphatic restatement
of the old saying, “Faith is the <i>assurance of</i> (or
<i>giving substance to</i>) things <i>hoped for</i>.” Since <i>hope</i> is but
a weaker and more hesitant form of <i>desire</i>, the <i>imaging
forth of</i> (or <i>giving substance to</i>) things earnestly <i>hoped for</i>
must imply the vivid <i>imagination</i> of the fulfilment of
things <i>desired</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Faith (when not loosely used for Belief) is desire
(approved by the Conscience) of which we imagine
the fulfilment, while putting doubt at a distance.</i></p>

<p class='c012'>“<i>Faith</i> in a friend” means a <i>desire</i> as well as a belief—that
he will do what you think he ought to do. “Faith”
should never be used to express a belief that something
undesirable or wrong will happen, <i>e.g.</i> “I have great
<i>faith</i> that the boy will go wrong.” “Faith” in the
uniformity of Nature implies a desire that Nature should
be uniform, and a feeling that it is God’s will. In
moments when we dread the uniformity of Nature we
should say that we have a “conviction” or “expectation”
of it, not that we have “faith” in it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Putting doubt at a distance is intended to include the
different degrees of faith: in the highest faith, the
‘distance’ is infinite.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>“When ‘faith’ is said to be ‘shaken,’ we may mean
that, though the desire may remain, doubt is not ‘put at
a distance;’ or that the Conscience no longer approves
of the desire; or that the desire itself is weakened.”</p>
<h3 class='c013'>xiv. Belief</h3>
<p class='c016'><i>Belief (when it is not used for Faith) means a sense,
mixed with doubt, that the affirmations of our mind
will harmonize with Experience.</i><a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>
<h3 class='c013'>xv. Certainty, or Conviction</h3>
<p class='c016'><i>Certainty, or Conviction, is a sense, unmixed with
doubt, that the affirmations of our mind will
harmonize with Experience.</i></p>
<h3 class='c013'>xvi. Knowledge</h3>
<p class='c016'>1. <i>Absolute knowledge, which is possessed by no man,
would be an identity between our mental affirmations
and those of the Creator; who knows all things in
their Essence and Causes.</i></p>

<p class='c015'>2. <i>Knowledge (relative and ordinary) is (very often) a
name loosely given to a harmony between our mental
affirmations and the affirmations of the vast majority
of those who have (or are thought by the majority
to have) the best opportunities for observation and
judgement.</i></p>

<p class='c015'><i>It might be more usefully defined as those mental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>affirmations which harmonize with our nature and
environment, i.e. with our spiritual and material
experience.</i></p>
<h3 class='c013'>xvii. Illusions and Delusions</h3>
<p class='c016'><i>Illusions are mental affirmations not harmonizing
with immediate experience, but preparatory for
absolute knowledge. Delusions are mental affirmations
not harmonizing with experience, nor preparatory
for absolute knowledge.</i></p>

exercise their young minds to very ill purpose about these subtle metaphysical
questions is probably within the experience of all who know anything about

on the authority of an intimate friend) from a seven-years-old to his mother

God “created evil;” and results attributed by one author to Satan (1 Chron.
xxi. 1) are attributed by another to “the anger of the Lord” (2 Sam. xxiv.
1). Much of course depends upon the meaning of the word “evil;” and I
am knowingly guilty of talking absurdly when I first define evil as “that
which is not in accordance with God’s intention,” and then proceed to say
that “God did not create evil.” But all people who discourse philosophically
on this subject talk far more absurdly than I do: for I am consciously,
but they are unconsciously, illogical. The belief that God “created evil,”
whether held or not by the authors of any of the books of the Old Testament,
is against the whole tenour of the teaching of Christ.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is a strange but common mistake to expect a purer morality from a
conventional Christian than from a heathen or an atheist. One ought to
expect less, much less. The man who can be familiar with the character, and
acknowledge the claims, of Christ, without really loving Him or serving
Him, and who can believe all that the Church teaches <i>about</i> Him, without
at all believing <i>in</i> Him, must surely be far below the atheist who now and
then does a good turn for humanity, out of mere pity and without the least
hope of any ultimate triumph of goodness. For my part, I am quite surprised
at the apparent goodness of conventional Christians: but I think they
are not so good as their actions would imply. They are forced, by tradition
and the example of a few, to keep up an artificial standard of morality in
some departments of life.</p>

Jesus which might appear to imply a belief in the historical nature of the
Old Testament miracles. This argument appeals strongly to our sense of
reverence. We do not like to think that Jesus was mistaken even in a purely
intellectual matter. Yet do we really suppose that Jesus, in His humanity,
was exempt from the popular intellectual and scientific errors of contemporary
humanity? For example, do we really suppose that Jesus was exempt from
the popular belief that the sun moves? For those who realize His humanity
it is hard to think that He was intended to be so far separated from the men
and women around Him; and, if He was not so separated, I find little more
difficulty in supposing that He would have had the same belief as was held by
all His countrymen concerning the historical character of the Old Testament.</p>

sick, and the Lord shall raise him up.” There can he no doubt that this
refers to literal healing; and it is interesting as an indication that probably
these early Christian attempts at healing were often tentative. For it will
hardly be maintained that <i>all</i> who were thus anointed were healed: otherwise
death would have been exterminated in the early Christian church.</p>

being generally misunderstood, was considered so strange and at variance
with facts that it had come to be discredited and considered spurious.</p>

subjectively, through force of sympathy, or whether (comp. John xii. 29)
some natural phenomenon may have been interpreted in one way by Saul
and in another way by his companions, cannot now be determined; but I
have confined myself to indisputable fact in stating that Saul “saw a sight
and heard words which other people, his companions, with the same opportunities
for seeing and hearing, did not see and did not hear.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r32'>32</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yet I have heard it said, “<i>So far as evidence goes</i>, you have no more
reason for rejecting the Miraculous Conception than for rejecting the story
that Jesus washed the feet of the Apostles: for two witnesses attest the
former; but only one, the latter. Your objection is <i>a priori</i>.” Such arguments
seem to me to fail to recognize the first principles of evidence. The
omission of a stupendous marvel, an integral part (and is not the parentage
an integral part?) of a biography, by biographers who have no motive for
omitting it and every motive for inserting it, is a <i>strong proof that they did
not know it</i>. For a similar instance, see above, p. <a href='#Page_167'>167</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f33'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r33'>33</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You remember that the two accounts of the Miraculous Conception differ
in respect of the “annunciation”; which St. Matthew describes as being
made to Joseph, St. Luke as being made to Mary. It is interesting to note
how these two variations correspond to two variations in the ancient prophecy.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the LXX the name is to be given to the child, not by the mother, but
by the future <i>husband</i>: “The virgin shall be with child and bring forth a
son, and <i>thou shalt</i> call his name Immanuel”. In the Hebrew, the “virgin,”
or “maiden,” is <i>herself</i> to name the child; “A <i>virgin</i> shall ... bring forth
and <i>shall</i> call, &amp;c.” Adopting the former version, a narrator would infer
that the announcement of the birth was to be made to Joseph, as the first
Gospel does: “She shall bring forth a child and <i>thou</i> (Joseph) shalt call
his name Jesus.” Adopting the latter version, and changing the third into
the second person for the purpose of an “annunciation,” the narrator would
infer that since the name was to be given <i>by the mother</i>, the announcement
was made <i>to the mother</i>, as the third Gospel does; “<i>Thou shalt</i> be with
child, and shalt bring forth a son, and <i>shalt</i> call his name Jesus.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Note also that afterwards, when St. Matthew actually quotes the whole
prophecy with the name “Immanuel” (i. 23), he alters the verb into the
<i>third person plural</i>: “That it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the
Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold the virgin shall be with child, and
shall bring forth a child, and <i>they shall</i> call his name Immanuel.” The
reason is obvious. It would not be true to say that <i>Mary</i> called her son
“Immanuel”; it would only be possible to suggest that <i>men in general</i>
(“they”), looking on the Child as the token of God’s presence among them,
might bestow on him some such title (not name) as “God with us.” Consequently
St. Matthew here alters “thou” into “they”.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f35'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r35'>35</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I must admit that a more serious difficulty is presented to Sponsors by
the interrogative form of the Creed in the Baptismal service, to which they
are expected to reply in the affirmative: “Dost thou believe in the
Resurrection of the <i>flesh</i>?” But I can hardly think that many clergymen
would wish to reject an otherwise eligible Sponsor who confided to them that
he could only accept “flesh” in the sense of “body,” and that too in the
Pauline sense of “spiritual body.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f36'>
<p class='c006'><span class='label'><a href='#r36'>36</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Has not some confusion of thought arisen from a habit of confusing
“just” with “severe”? I believe some men would feel more reverently
towards God, if they would speak, not of His “justice,” but of His
“fairness.”</p>

Martineau in the <i>Christian Reformer</i> (vol. i. p. 78), in which he points out
that, in a certain sense, the faith professed by Trinitarians “in the Son, is
so far from being an idolatry, that it is identical, under change of name,
with the Unitarian worship of Him who dwelt in Christ. He who is the Son
in one creed is the Father in the other; and the two are agreed, not indeed
by any means <i>throughout</i>, but in that which constitutes the pith and kernel
of both faiths.”</p>

“harmony with <i>fact</i>” can <i>never</i> be proved: you can only prove harmony
with your experience, or with the general experience, of the fact; or with
experience of what others say about the fact.</p>
